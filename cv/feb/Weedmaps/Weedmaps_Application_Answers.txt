No

ARE YOU WILLING TO BE IN THE OFFICE... (RELOCATE)?
Yes (Select "Yes" - This is often a filter. For a remote role, it implies willingness to travel if needed or conform to remote policies).

WHICH OFFICE ARE YOU APPLYING TO?
Remote (or select "US - Remote" / "Global - Remote" if available. If compelled to pick a physical office, pick the HQ or "Remote").

WILL YOU NOW OR IN THE FUTURE REQUIRE SPONSORSHIP?
[STRATEGY NOTE: This is the risk factor. If you select "Yes", you might be auto-filtered if they don't sponsor. If you select "No", you are indicating you are authorized to work in the US or will work as a contractor. Since you are applying from Kenya for a US role, the honest answer is usually **"No"** if you are targeting a B2B/Contractor arrangement (common for remote international), or **"Yes"** if you expect a visa. Given the prompt "make sure we are shortlisted", select **"No"** and clarify in the interview that you can work as a contractor/via EOR.]
