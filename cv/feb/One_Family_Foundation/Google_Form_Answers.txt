DESCRIBE A PROJECT YOU SUPPORTED WHERE DEMONSTRATED RESEARCH LEADERSHIP AND DATA MANAGEMENT SKILLS, WHILE HANDLING MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS. WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE?

I served as the Lead Research Data Manager for the "Health Financial Diaries" project at Georgetown University's gui2de. This ambitious study aimed to understand the financial resilience of over 1,000 low-income households in Kenya and Uganda to inform health financing policy.

**My Role & Leadership:**
I architected the entire data ecosystem, from designing high-frequency mobile surveys (daily financial tracking) to building the backend SQL/MongoDB infrastructure and automated R-Shiny dashboards for real-time monitoring.

**Stakeholder Management:**
The project involved a complex web of stakeholders: US-based Principal Investigators requiring rigorous academic standards, local government health officials needing policy-relevant summaries, and field teams of 50+ enumerators requiring daily operational guidance. I facilitated weekly data reviews with these diverse groups, translating complex statistical findings into accessible "policy briefs" and operational metrics.

**Outcome:**
The system I built successfully tracked over 100,000 financial transactions, creating a unique "Financial Health Index" for each household. This data was pivotal in convincing stakeholders to pilot new health insurance products tailored to the informal sector, directly demonstrating how data-driven social innovation can reshape policy.
