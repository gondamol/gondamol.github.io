# **Against All Odds: A Journey of Resilience**
:::

## **The Beginning: Rising from Adversity**

Growing up as an **orphaned child with limited resources** in rural Kenya, the odds were stacked against me. Without the safety net that many take for granted, every educational milestone required extraordinary determination, resourcefulness, and an unwavering belief that **data and education could change lives**.

::: {.highlight-box}
### üåü From Struggle to Strength

**What shaped me:**
- **Loss taught me resilience** - Losing parents early instilled a drive to create lasting impact
- **Scarcity taught me resourcefulness** - Limited resources sharpened my problem-solving abilities  
- **Adversity taught me empathy** - Personal challenges deepened my commitment to health equity  
- **Community taught me collaboration** - Support from mentors fueled my passion for capacity building

**Against all odds, I made it this far** - and now I'm positioned to lead transformative global health initiatives.
