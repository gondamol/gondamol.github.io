## Why Analysts Need Data Engineering Skills

If you're constantly:

- Waiting for someone to send you “the latest extract”
- Copy-pasting CSVs into Excel every week
- Fixing the **same data errors** again and again

…you don’t just have an analysis problem—you have a **data engineering problem**.

You don't need to become a full-time engineer, but you *do* need enough skills to:

- Automate routine data pulls
- Clean and standardize datasets
- Build simple but reliable pipelines and views

## The Core Skills (80/20 View)

### 1. SQL as Your Superpower

- Learn:
  - Joins, aggregations, window functions
  - Common table expressions (CTEs)
  - Basic performance thinking (indexes, filtering early)

### 2. File & Table Organization

- Design:
  - Clear folder structures (raw, staging, analytics)
  - Consistent table naming and column conventions

### 3. Simple Orchestration

- Use:
  - Cron jobs, R scripts, or simple Python scripts
  - Cloud notebooks (Kaggle, Colab) + scheduled jobs where possible

### 4. Documentation

- Document:
  - Where data comes from
  - How it’s transformed
  - Known limitations and caveats

## A Simple Analytics Pipeline You Can Build This Month

**Goal:** A weekly-updated dataset for a dashboard (e.g., facility visits, survey responses).

Steps:

1. **Ingestion:**
   - Pull CSV/Excel exports from Kobo/ODK/REDCap
   - Save into `data/raw/` with date stamps
2. **Cleaning:**
   - Use R or Python to:
     - Fix variable types
     - Normalize codes (facility IDs, districts)
     - Remove duplicates
   - Save into `data/clean/`
3. **Modeling:**
   - Use SQL to build:
     - A clean “fact” table (visits/events)
     - Dimension tables (facilities, patients)
   - Create an analytics view used by your dashboard
4. **Automation:**
   - Wrap steps in a single script
   - Schedule weekly using cron, Task Scheduler, or a simple CI job

## Tools You Can Start With (No Big Infra)

- Local:
  - PostgreSQL or SQLite database
  - R + `dbplyr` or Python + `sqlalchemy`
- Cloud-ish:
  - Google BigQuery sandbox (for small datasets)
  - DuckDB in local files

Focus on learning **one** stack end-to-end instead of chasing every shiny tool.

## Turning These Skills Into a Career Edge

When applying for roles, highlight:

- “Designed and automated a pipeline that updates X dashboard weekly without manual effort.”
- “Reduced time-to-insight from 3 days to 30 minutes by standardizing and modeling datasets.”
- “Implemented basic data quality checks and documentation for repeatable analysis.”

Even if your title is “Data Analyst,” this is the work of an **Analytics Engineer**—and it makes you much more valuable.
