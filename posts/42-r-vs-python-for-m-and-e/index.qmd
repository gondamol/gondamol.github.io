## The Real Question for M&amp;E Professionals

It’s not:

> “Which language is better?”

It’s:

> “Which language gets me from raw survey data to validated indicators and reports **faster and more reliably**?”

## When R Wins

Best for:

- Heavy survey work
- Complex statistics
- Reproducible reports (Quarto, R Markdown)

Pros:

- Massive ecosystem for stats and survey analysis
- Great integration with RStudio
- Natural fit for many global health workflows

---

## When Python Wins

Best for:

- ML, NLP, integration with production systems
- When your team already uses Python for engineering

Pros:

- Huge general-purpose ecosystem
- Great for scraping, APIs, and automation

## My Recommendation for M&amp;E & Health Evaluation

- If your main work is:
  - Surveys
  - Monitoring indicators
  - Regressions and impact analysis

➡️ **Start with R.**

- If you later:
  - Need to integrate with production systems
  - Want to do more ML/engineering

➡️ Add Python on top.

You don’t need to pick a side forever—**you need a tool that helps you ship evaluations now**.
