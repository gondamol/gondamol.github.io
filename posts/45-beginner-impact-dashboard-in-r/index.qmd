## Why Start with a Simple Dashboard

You don’t need a complex app:

- 2–3 tabs
- 5–7 key indicators
- Clear filters (date, geography, facility)

Your goal is to:

- Show **you can move from static charts to interactive tools**
- Give program teams something they can actually use

## A Minimal Architecture

- Data:
  - A clean table of events/visits
  - A lookup table for facilities/geographies
- R:
  - `shiny` or `flexdashboard`
  - `dplyr` + `ggplot2`

Tabs:

1. Overview
2. Trends
3. Disaggregation

## Portfolio Tip

Host your dashboard:

- On shinyapps.io (free tier)
- Or publish screenshots + code on GitHub

Include in your CV:

> “Built and deployed an interactive dashboard showing X indicators across Y facilities, used by Z stakeholders for quarterly review.”

This single project can dramatically elevate your profile as a junior analyst or M&amp;E specialist.
