## The Harsh Truth About Data Analytics Portfolios

Last month, I reviewed 500+ data analytics portfolios for my hiring team.

**Result: 487 were immediately rejected.**

Not because the candidates lacked skills, but because their portfolios failed to showcase them properly.

**This post will show you the 13 portfolios that made it through** - and exactly how to build one that stands out.

## What Hiring Managers Actually Look For (In Order)

### 1. **Can They Solve Real Problems?** (40%)
Show business impact, not just technical skills.

### 2. **Can They Communicate?** (30%)
Your README and presentation matter more than your code.

### 3. **Are They Technically Competent?** (20%)
Clean code, proper tools, best practices.

### 4. **Do They Show Initiative?** (10%)
Unique projects, continuous learning, community involvement.

### **Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Why It Matters:**
- Shows statistical thinking
- Proves you can find patterns
- Demonstrates hypothesis testing

**Structure:**
```
Research Question: What factors influence employee attrition?

Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Dataset

Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)
2. Univariate Analysis (distributions)
3. Bivariate Analysis (correlations)
4. Multivariate Analysis (complex relationships)
5. Statistical Testing (t-tests, chi-square)

Key Findings:
1. Employees with <2 years tenure have 47% attrition rate
2. Overtime workers are 3.2x more likely to leave
3. Job satisfaction score <2 predicts 68% of attrition

Statistical Evidence:
- Chi-square test: p < 0.001 (overtime vs attrition)
- T-test: Significant difference in satisfaction scores (p=0.003)
```

**Example Datasets:**
- [IBM HR Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)

**Why It Matters:**
- SQL is non-negotiable (78% of jobs)
- Shows database thinking
- Demonstrates query optimization

**Project Example:**
```
Business Problem: Analyze customer purchase patterns to optimize inventory

Dataset: E-Commerce Database (4 tables)

1. Complex JOINs (3+ tables)
2. Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
3. CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
4. Subqueries
5. Aggregations with GROUP BY
6. Date Functions

Sample Queries:

-- Find top 10 customers by lifetime value
WITH customer_totals AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) as ltv
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT c.customer_name, ct.ltv
FROM customers c
JOIN customer_totals ct ON c.customer_id = ct.customer_id
ORDER BY ct.ltv DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Calculate 30-day retention rate
WITH first_purchase AS (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) as first_date
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
repeat_purchase AS (
    SELECT f.customer_id
    FROM first_purchase f
    JOIN orders o ON f.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN f.first_date AND f.first_date + INTERVAL '30 days'
    AND o.order_date > f.first_date
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT r.customer_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT f.customer_id) as retention_rate
FROM first_purchase f
LEFT JOIN repeat_purchase r ON f.customer_id = r.customer_id;

Insights:
1. 30-day retention rate: 32%
2. Top 10% customers generate 65% of revenue
3. Average time between purchases: 23 days

## Interview Preparation

**Be ready to:**
1. **Walk through each project** (5-minute presentation)
2. **Explain your decisions** (why this method vs. that)
3. **Discuss challenges** (what went wrong, how you fixed it)
4. **Show business impact** (not just technical details)
5. **Demonstrate passion** (why this project specifically?)

**Practice Script:**
```
"For this project, I analyzed e-commerce data to help a company understand their customer churn.

The dataset had 100K customers over 3 years. I started by cleaning the data - there were 5% missing values which I handled by [method].

I then explored the data and found that customers who didn't make a purchase in 90 days had a 70% chance of never returning. This was the key insight.

I built a simple predictive model using Python and scikit-learn, achieving 85% accuracy in predicting churn.

The business recommendation was to implement a 60-day re-engagement campaign, which could potentially save $500K in lost revenue annually.

The hardest part was feature engineering - I had to create recency, frequency, and monetary value features which required careful date calculations.

You can see the full analysis on my GitHub, and I'd be happy to walk through any part in more detail."
