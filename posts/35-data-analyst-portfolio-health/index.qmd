## Why Generic Portfolios Don’t Work in Global Health

- Sales dashboards
- Generic e-commerce datasets
- Kaggle competitions with no context

- Impact metrics
- Facility or patient flows
- Equity and access questions

## How to Make Each Project Recruiter-Friendly

- Provide:
  - Short context (what problem are we solving?)
  - Plain-language summary of findings
  - 3–5 clear visuals
- Highlight:
  - Data limitations
  - How you would improve the study if you had more resources

By using **health & development contexts**, you show that you can think beyond numbers and connect to real-world impact.
