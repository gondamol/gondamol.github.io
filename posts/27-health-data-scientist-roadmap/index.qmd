## Why Health Data Science Is Different

Health data science is not just about models—it’s about **patients, facilities, financing, and policy**.

- Your analyses influence:
  - Who gets enrolled into a program
  - Which facilities receive resources
  - Whether a donor continues funding a life-saving intervention
- That means:
  - You must respect **ethics, equity, and context**
  - You need both **statistical rigor** and **domain understanding**

## The 4 Pillars of Health Data Science

1. **Data Foundations**
   - Data types: patient-level, facility-level, claims, survey, registry
   - Common formats: CSV, REDCap exports, Kobo/ODK, DHIS2
   - Data quality: duplicates, missingness, inconsistent IDs

2. **Stats & Methods**
   - Descriptive stats, confidence intervals, regression
   - Survival analysis for time-to-event outcomes
   - Longitudinal analysis for repeated measures

3. **Tools**
   - R (tidyverse, survival, ggplot2)
   - SQL for querying large tables
   - Quarto/R Markdown for reproducible reports

4. **Communication**
   - One-page briefs for program leads
   - Visual dashboards for non-technical stakeholders
   - Clean, annotated code for other analysts

## 12-Month Roadmap (While Working or Studying)

### Months 1–3: Strengthen Foundations

- Excel + basic statistics
- Learn R basics:
  - Import, clean, transform, visualize
- Build 2–3 small projects:
  - Vaccination coverage trends
  - Facility readiness scores

### Months 4–6: Health-Focused Analysis

- Learn:
  - Regression (linear, logistic)
  - Survival analysis for outcomes like time-to-default
  - Intro to causal diagrams (DAGs)
- Projects:
  - Malaria incidence trend analysis
  - Health worker density vs outcomes

### Months 7–9: Reproducible Research & Dashboards

- Learn:
  - Quarto for automated reports
  - Shiny or basic dashboards (or Power BI if your team uses it)
- Build:
  - A reproducible health facility dashboard
  - A quarterly report pipeline (data → R → HTML/PDF)

### Months 10–12: Real-World Projects

- Volunteer:
  - Support a university department, NGO, or clinic with data cleaning and simple dashboards
- Build:
  - 2–3 end-to-end case studies you can show employers

---

## Portfolio Ideas for Health Data Scientists

You can stand out with a portfolio that includes:

- A dashboard showing **hypertension control rates** across facilities
- A survival curve analysis for **time-to-default** among patients
- A simulation exploring how **health financing changes** affect out-of-pocket costs

Each project should include:

- Data description and limitations
- Methods, clearly explained
- 2–4 key charts
- 3–5 actionable recommendations

---

## Where to Look for Your First Role

- Research Assistant / Data Analyst roles in:
  - Universities (schools of public health, epidemiology, biostatistics)
  - NGOs running health programs
  - Monitoring & Evaluation teams
- Keywords to search:
  - “Health data analyst”
  - “Biostatistics assistant”
  - “Monitoring & Evaluation analyst”

You don’t need to start in a “Data Scientist” title. If you **own the data pipeline and deliver insights that change decisions**, your title will catch up.
