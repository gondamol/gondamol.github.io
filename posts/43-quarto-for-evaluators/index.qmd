## Why Quarto Is a Game-Changer

Typical M&amp;E reporting workflow:

- Do analysis in R/Excel
- Copy charts into Word
- Manually update every quarter

Quarto lets you:

- Keep analysis and report in the **same place**
- Regenerate everything when new data arrives
- Output HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint from one source

## What a Quarto Workflow Looks Like

1. Import and clean data in R/Python
2. Calculate indicators
3. Create charts and tables
4. Write interpretation text
5. Render to:
   - `index.html`
   - `report.pdf`
   - `slides.html` (presentations)

You change the data and **press render**—the report updates.

## Portfolio Idea

Build a Quarto report that:

- Summarizes key indicators for a programme
- Includes:
  - Data quality section
  - Trends over time
  - Equity breakdowns
- Renders as:
  - HTML for the web
  - PDF for donors

This shows that you understand **both analysis and communication**, which is exactly what evaluators need.
