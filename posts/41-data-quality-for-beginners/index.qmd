## Why Data Quality Is Your Real Job

If your data is trash, your:

- Models are misleading
- Dashboards tell the wrong story
- Policy recommendations can hurt people

Data quality is not “extra” work—it’s core to being a serious analyst.

## 7 Checks to Automate on Every Dataset

1. **Missingness patterns** by variable and group  
2. **Uniqueness** of IDs  
3. **Range checks** for numeric variables  
4. **Category consistency** for factors/coded responses  
5. **Cross-field logic** (e.g., age vs date of birth, pregnancy vs sex)  
6. **Duplicates** and near-duplicates  
7. **Date/time sanity** (ordering, impossible dates)  

Automate these in:

- R (with tidyverse/janitor)
- Python (with pandas)

## How to Turn This Into a Portfolio Project

- Take any public health or development dataset
- Build:
  - A script that runs all 7 checks
  - A short report or dashboard summarizing issues
- Include:
  - A “recommended data cleaning plan”
  - Examples of how findings explain weird results

Great analysts are **paranoid about data quality**—and employers love that.
