## What a Logframe Really Is

A logical framework is just a **structured way to tell the story**:

- What do we do?
- What do we produce?
- What changes do we expect?

Columns:

- Narrative summary
- Indicators
- Means of verification
- Assumptions/risks

Rows:

- Goal / Impact
- Outcomes
- Outputs
- Activities

---

## How to Read a Logframe Like a Pro

Ask:

- Are outputs sufficient to plausibly lead to outcomes?
- Are indicators measurable with available data systems?
- Are assumptions vaguely inspirational or actually testable?

As a data person, you can add a lot by:

- Suggesting **measurable, realistic indicators**
- Challenging vague assumptions

## Quick Exercise

Take any project concept note and:

- Sketch a 4x4 logframe
- Define 1–2 indicators per level
- Identify 3–4 key risks

You’ve done more logical thinking than many “formal” project designs.
