## The Reality Check

**What you expected:**
- Building cool ML models
- Creating beautiful dashboards
- Impressing everyone with insights

**The reality:**
- 60% cleaning messy data
- 30% meetings and explaining basic concepts
- 10% actual analysis

**And that's okay!** Every data analyst goes through this.

---

## Week 1-2: Onboarding

**Your mission:** Learn the business, not just the tools.

**Do this:**
- [ ] Schedule 1:1s with key stakeholders
- [ ] Ask for access to all data sources
- [ ] Review past reports and dashboards
- [ ] Document everything in a personal wiki
- [ ] Ask "stupid" questions (no question is stupid)

**Don't do this:**
- ❌ Try to impress with complex analysis immediately
- ❌ Criticize existing work
- ❌ Say "this is easy" about anything

**Key questions to ask:**
1. "What are our top 3 business metrics?"
2. "What data sources do we use?"
3. "Who are the main stakeholders?"
4. "What are the biggest data challenges?"
5. "What does success look like in this role?"

---

## Week 3-4: Quick Wins

**Find one small problem and solve it well.**

**Good first projects:**
- Automate a manual report
- Fix a broken dashboard
- Clean up a messy dataset
- Document an undocumented process

**Bad first projects:**
- Rebuild entire data warehouse
- Implement ML from scratch
- Question executive strategy

---

## Month 2-3: Build Relationships

**Success in data = 50% technical + 50% relationships**

**Build alliances with:**
- Business stakeholders (understand their pain)
- Engineers (they control data access)
- Other analysts (learn from them)
- Your manager (set clear expectations)

**How to build trust:**
1. Deliver on time, every time
2. Communicate proactively
3. Admit when you don't know
4. Show business impact, not just technical prowess
5. Make others look good

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

### **Mistake 1: Perfectionism**
**Bad:** Spending 2 weeks on perfect analysis  
**Good:** Ship 80% solution in 3 days, iterate

### **Mistake 2: Jargon Overload**
**Bad:** "The multivariate regression shows heteroscedasticity"  
**Good:** "Sales are more unpredictable in certain regions"

### **Mistake 3: Analysis Paralysis**
**Bad:** "I need more data before deciding"  
**Good:** "Based on what we have, here's my recommendation"

### **Mistake 4: Not Asking for Help**
**Bad:** Struggling alone for days  
**Good:** Ask after 30 minutes of trying

### **Mistake 5: Over-promising**
**Bad:** "I can have this done by tomorrow"  
**Good:** "I'll need 3 days, but can give you preliminary findings tomorrow"

## Essential Skills for First 90 Days

**Technical (you probably know these):**
- SQL
- Excel
- Python/R
- Tableau/Power BI

**Soft skills (you probably underestimate these):**
- Translating business questions into data questions
- Presenting to non-technical audiences
- Managing stakeholder expectations
- Prioritizing requests
- Saying "no" diplomatically

---

## How to Handle Common Situations

### **"Can you pull this data real quick?"**
**Don't:** Drop everything and do it  
**Do:** "I can get this to you by [realistic time]. Is that okay? I'm currently working on [priority task]."

### **"Why don't we have this data?"**
**Don't:** Blame IT/engineering  
**Do:** "Great question! Let me look into what it would take to collect this. In the meantime, here's similar data we do have..."

### **"This dashboard is wrong!"**
**Don't:** Get defensive  
**Do:** "Thanks for catching this! Can you show me what you're seeing? Let me investigate and get back to you by [time]."

### **"Make the numbers look better"**
**Don't:** Manipulate data  
**Do:** "I can show different views of the data, but the underlying numbers are what they are. Here are some positive angles we can highlight..."

1. **You'll feel like an impostor.** Everyone does. It goes away after ~6 months.

2. **Business context > technical skills.** Understanding why matters more than how.
