## Why Traditional Surveys Miss the Real Story

Standard household surveys often ask:

- “How much did you spend on health in the last month/3 months/12 months?”

But real life is messy:

- People forget small but frequent expenses
- Lump-sum costs (e.g., hospitalization) distort recall
- Informal payments and borrowing are underreported

That’s where **health financial diaries** come in.

## What Are Health Financial Diaries?

Health financial diaries:

- Track **daily or weekly** health-related financial flows, such as:
  - Clinic fees
  - Drugs and diagnostics
  - Transport to facilities
  - Lost income due to illness
  - Borrowing, gifts, and asset sales to pay for care
- Used over weeks or months to:
  - Capture volatility
  - Understand coping strategies
  - Reveal hidden burdens of illness

## What They Let You Analyze

With diaries, you can:

- Map **cash flow shocks** due to health events
- Estimate **catastrophic health expenditure** more accurately
- Understand **borrowing patterns and informal insurance**
- Link episodes of illness to:
  - **Treatment choices**
  - **Facility types**
  - **Delays and drop-outs**

## Challenges (And How to Design Around Them)

- Participant fatigue:
  - Keep instruments short and focused
  - Use prompts (SMS, phone, in-person visits)
- Data quality:
  - Train enumerators well
  - Use high-frequency checks to catch inconsistencies
- Ethics and burden:
  - Compensate fairly
  - Respect privacy and sensitivity around finances

## Portfolio Idea: A Mini Financial Diaries Simulation

Even without field data, you can:

- Simulate 50–100 households with:
  - Daily income
  - Random health shocks
  - Different coping strategies
- Use R to:
  - Plot daily cash flows
  - Identify “catastrophic” events
  - Compare “with insurance” vs “without insurance” scenarios

Publish:

- A small dashboard or Quarto report with:
  - Key charts
  - A short interpretation section

This shows you understand **health financing at the household level**, not just at the macro budget level.
