## The Mobile Data Collection Revolution

Gone are the days of paper forms, manual data entry, and transcription errors. **Mobile data collection** has transformed how we gather information in the field, especially in health research and development projects.

**Why Mobile Data Collection?**

✅ **Real-time data collection** - No delays in data entry
✅ **Reduced errors** - Built-in validation and skip logic
✅ **Cost-effective** - No paper, printing, or data entry costs
✅ **GPS integration** - Automatic location capture
✅ **Rich media** - Photos, audio, videos
✅ **Offline capability** - Works without internet
✅ **Data security** - Encrypted transmission

**Statistics:**
- **70% reduction** in data collection time
- **50% fewer errors** compared to paper
- **60% cost savings** over traditional methods

## Planning Your Mobile Data Collection System

### Step 1: Define Your Objectives

Before designing forms, ask:

1. **What information do you need?**
2. **Who will collect the data?**
3. **Where will data be collected?** (Internet availability?)
4. **How often?** (One-time or repeated?)
5. **Who needs access to the data?**
6. **What level of data quality is required?**

### Step 2: Choose Your Platform

**Decision Matrix:**

| Factor | ODK/Kobo | CommCare | SurveyCTO | REDCap |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Cost | Free | $$$ | $$ | Free* |
| Ease of Use | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Customization | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Case Management | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Offline Capability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

*REDCap free for institutions with license

**My Recommendation for Beginners:** Start with **KoboToolbox** or **ODK Central**

## Designing Effective Data Collection Forms

### Form Design Principles

#### 1. **Keep It Simple** 📝

```xml
<!-- Bad: Too complex -->
<input ref="patient_details_including_demographic_and_clinical_information">

<!-- Good: Clear and concise -->
<input ref="patient_name">
<input ref="age">
<input ref="symptoms">
```

#### 2. **Use Appropriate Question Types**

**Text Input:**
```
Type: text
Use for: Names, open-ended responses
```

**Integer/Decimal:**
```
Type: integer, decimal
Use for: Age, weight, counts
Constraint: . >= 0
```

**Select One (Radio buttons):**
```
Type: select_one
Use for: Gender, yes/no questions
Choices: yes, no
```

**Select Multiple (Checkboxes):**
```
Type: select_multiple
Use for: Symptoms, risk factors
Choices: fever, cough, headache
```

**Date:**
```
Type: date
Use for: Birth date, visit date
```

**Geopoint:**
```
Type: geopoint
Use for: Location of household, facility
```

**Photo:**
```
Type: image
Use for: Documentation, verification
```

#### 3. **Implement Skip Logic**

```
| type | name | label | relevant |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| select_one yn | pregnant | Are you pregnant? | ${gender} = 'female' |
| date | delivery_date | Expected delivery date | ${pregnant} = 'yes' |
```

#### 4. **Add Constraints and Validation**

```
| type | name | label | constraint | constraint_message |
|------|------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| integer | age | Age in years | . >= 0 and . <= 120 | Age must be 0-120 |
| decimal | temperature | Temperature (°C) | . >= 35 and . <= 42 | Temp must be 35-42°C |
| text | phone | Phone number | regex(., '^\d{10}$') | Enter 10 digits |
```

#### 5. **Use Calculations**

```
| type | name | label | calculation |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| decimal | weight | Weight (kg) | |
| decimal | height | Height (m) | |
| calculate | bmi | | ${weight} / (${height} * ${height}) |
| note | bmi_display | Your BMI is ${bmi} | |
```

---

## Quality Assurance Best Practices

### 1. **Real-Time Monitoring**

```r
# R script for daily data quality checks
library(tidyverse)
library(ruODK)

# Download today's data
data <- odk_submission_get()

# Check for issues
issues <- data %>%
  mutate(
    # Completeness
    complete = !is.na(name) & !is.na(age),
    # Logic errors
    age_valid = age >= 0 & age <= 120,
    # GPS accuracy
    gps_accurate = gps_accuracy < 10
  ) %>%
  filter(!complete | !age_valid | !gps_accurate)

# Send alert if issues found
if (nrow(issues) > 0) {
  send_email_alert(issues)
}
```

### 2. **Regular Field Supervision**

**Supervision checklist:**
- [ ] Observe actual interviews
- [ ] Check informed consent process
- [ ] Verify GPS coordinates
- [ ] Review photo quality
- [ ] Check data completeness
- [ ] Provide feedback

### 3. **Data Validation Rules**

**In-form validation:**
```
- Age must be reasonable (0-120)
- Dates must not be in future
- GPS accuracy < 10 meters
- Required photos must be clear
- Phone numbers must be valid format
```

**Post-collection validation:**
```r
# Automated checks
check_duplicates()
check_outliers()
check_missing_required()
check_logical_consistency()
```

## Data Management

### 1. **Data Security**

✅ **Encryption:**
- Server-to-device encryption (HTTPS)
- At-rest encryption on devices
- Encrypted backups

✅ **Access Control:**
```
Roles in ODK Central:
- Project Manager (full access)
- Data Collector (submit only)
- Data Viewer (read only)
- Analyst (download data)
```

✅ **Regular Backups:**
```bash
# Automated daily backup
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh
```

### 2. **Data Export and Analysis**

```r
# Export from ODK to R
library(ruODK)

# Set credentials
ruODK::ru_setup(
  url = "https://your-server.com",
  un = "your-email@domain.com",
  pw = "your-password"
)

# Download data
data <- ruODK::odk_submission_get(
  pid = 1,
  fid = "patient_survey"
)

# Clean and analyze
clean_data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(patient_id)) %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = cut(age, breaks = c(0, 18, 65, Inf),
                    labels = c("Child", "Adult", "Senior"))
  )
```
