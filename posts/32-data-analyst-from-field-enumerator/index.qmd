## Why Enumerators Make Great Analysts

If you've worked as a field enumerator, you already understand:

- What questions confuse respondents
- How skip patterns work in real life
- What “bad data” looks like on the ground

That perspective is **gold** for data teams—if you can add technical skills on top.

## Step 1: Own the Tools You Already Use

If you’ve used:

- ODK / SurveyCTO / Kobo / REDCap

Learn the **back end**:

- How forms are designed
- How data is stored
- How exports are structured

Ask for:

- Access to **practice datasets**
- A chance to help with basic cleaning in Excel or R

## Step 2: Learn the Core Data Stack

You don’t need 10 tools. Start with:

- Excel:
  - Filters, pivot tables, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP
- R or Python:
  - Import CSVs
  - Clean and transform
  - Create summary tables and charts
- SQL:
  - SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOIN

Build portfolio pieces using **realistic survey data** (anonymized or public).

## Step 3: Volunteer for Hybrid Tasks

In your next assignment:

- Volunteer to:
  - Run basic data checks at the end of each day
  - Help prepare summary tables for supervisors
  - Document field challenges that explain data patterns

You become the bridge between **field teams and analysts**—and that’s often how you get promoted.

## Step 4: Package Your Story for Recruiters

On your CV and LinkedIn:

- Highlight:
  - “Collected data from X participants across Y sites”
  - “Supported daily data quality review and feedback”
  - “Helped design or refine digital survey tools”
- Add:
  - 2–3 small data projects (cleaning + analysis + charts)

You’re not “just an enumerator.” You’re someone who **understands data at its source** and is learning to drive insights.
