## Why You Need Projects, Not Just Courses

Courses teach you **what tools exist**.

Projects show:

- You can connect tools together
- You understand data lifecycle
- You can ship something useful

## 7 Project Ideas

1. **Survey Data Pipeline**
   - Ingest XLSForm/CSV exports
   - Clean and load into a SQLite/PostgreSQL database

2. **Public Health API Ingestion**
   - Pull daily COVID-19 or vaccination data
   - Store and aggregate for dashboarding

3. **Job Market Scraper**
   - Collect job postings for data roles
   - Analyze skills demand over time

4. **Data Quality Monitor**
   - Check incoming survey batches
   - Flag outliers and unusual patterns

5. **Simple Data Warehouse**
   - Model fact and dimension tables for a small NGO

6. **Dashboard Data Feed**
   - Build a pipeline that refreshes dashboard tables weekly

7. **ETL for an Evaluation Study**
   - Merge baseline, midline, and endline datasets
   - Produce analysis-ready panel data

## How to Present These Projects

For each project:

- 1–2 paragraphs: Problem & context
- Diagram: Source → Transform → Store → Use
- Screenshots: Logs, tables, dashboards
- Key learning points and “what I’d improve next”

Recruiters care less about buzzwords and more about proof that you can **get data from A to B reliably**.
