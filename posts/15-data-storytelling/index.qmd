## Why Data Storytelling Matters

**Hard truth:** Nobody cares about your analysis until you tell them why they should.

Your stakeholders don't want:
- ❌ 50-slide presentations
- ❌ Technical jargon
- ❌ Tables of numbers
- ❌ "Here's what I found"

They want:
- ✅ Clear recommendations
- ✅ Business impact
- ✅ What to do next
- ✅ "Here's why this matters to YOU"

## The 3-Act Structure for Data Stories

### **Act 1: The Setup (Context)**
- What's the current situation?
- Why does it matter?
- What question are we answering?

### **Act 2: The Conflict (Insight)**
- What did the data reveal?
- What's surprising or important?
- Show the evidence

### **Act 3: The Resolution (Action)**
- What should we do?
- What's the expected impact?
- What's the next step?

## Example: Bad vs Good Data Story

### **❌ Bad Presentation:**
"Our conversion rate is 3.2%. Last month it was 3.5%. Mobile is at 2.1%, desktop is at 4.8%. Here are 47 charts..."

### **✅ Good Story:**
"**We're losing $50K monthly because our mobile experience is broken.**

[Show visual: Mobile conversion 56% lower than desktop]

Three weeks ago, our overall conversion rate dropped from 3.5% to 3.2%. Seems small, but it's costing us $50,000 per month.

[Show data: Revenue impact calculation]

When I dug into the data, I found the problem: mobile conversion crashed after our site redesign. Desktop users convert at 4.8%, but mobile users - who are 60% of our traffic - convert at only 2.1%.

[Show comparison: Mobile vs Desktop funnel]

**The solution:** Our new checkout has a bug on mobile that's causing errors. Fixing this could recover $45K monthly.

**Next steps:**
1. Fix the mobile bug (2 days)
2. Run A/B test (1 week)
3. Monitor recovery

**I recommend we prioritize this over all other projects this sprint.**"

## The SCQA Framework

**Situation:** Current state  
**Complication:** The problem  
**Question:** What should we do?  
**Answer:** Your recommendation

**Example:**
- **S:** "We spend $100K monthly on Facebook ads"
- **C:** "But 70% of leads don't convert"
- **Q:** "How do we improve lead quality?"
- **A:** "Focus budget on lookalike audiences - they convert 3x better"
