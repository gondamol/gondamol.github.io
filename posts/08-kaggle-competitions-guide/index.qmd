# Read top discussions
# Review evaluation metric
```

**Day 18-20: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data
train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')

# Basic info
print(train.info())
print(train.describe())

# Check missing values
print(train.isnull().sum())

# Visualize distributions
train.hist(bins=30, figsize=(15,10))
plt.show()

# Correlation matrix
corr = train.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
```

**Day 21-24: Feature Engineering & Modeling**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Feature engineering
# ... (specific to competition)

# Split data
X = train.drop('target', axis=1)
y = train['target']
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Validate
predictions = model.predict(X_val)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_val, predictions)}")
```

**Day 25-27: Iterate & Improve**
- Try different models
- Feature engineering
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Ensemble methods

**Day 28-30: Submit & Document**

    'PassengerId': test['PassengerId'],
    'Survived': test_predictions
})
submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)

# Upload to Kaggle
# Document your approach in notebook
```

# Ensemble predictions (simple average)
rf_pred = rf.predict_proba(X_test)
gb_pred = gb.predict_proba(X_test)
lr_pred = lr.predict_proba(X_test)

final_pred = (rf_pred + gb_pred + lr_pred) / 3
```

**5. Cross-Validation**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
