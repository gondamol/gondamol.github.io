## Why Tech Loves A/B Tests (And What Health Can Learn)

In tech:

- A/B testing is used to:
  - Optimize click-through rates
  - Test new features
  - Improve revenue

In health and development:

- Stakes are different:
  - We’re dealing with well-being, safety, and sometimes life-or-death

But we *can* borrow experimentation ideas carefully.

## What A/B Testing Looks Like in Health

Examples:

- Testing two reminder messages for clinic appointments
- Comparing two formats of health education materials
- Evaluating two outreach strategies for vaccination

Key safeguards:

- Ethical review and approvals
- Informed consent where appropriate
- Clear principle: **no group is offered worse than current standard of care**

## How This Relates to RCTs

A/B tests are, in essence:

- Simple randomized controlled trials with:
  - A small number of arms
  - Large samples
  - Clear short-term outcomes

Differences:

- In tech: outcomes are often clicks and purchases
- In health: outcomes are attendance, adherence, health status, equity

## How a Junior Analyst Can Contribute

- Help design:
  - Outcome measures
  - Randomization procedures
- Help implement:
  - Data collection tools
  - Analysis pipelines
- Help interpret:
  - Not just “did it work?” but “for whom?” and “why?”

Experimentation in health requires both **rigor and humility**. If you can bring both, you’ll be a huge asset.
