## A Dashboard That Changes Lives

On November 26, 2024, I watched Governor Anyang' Nyong'o officially launch the **Kisumu County Cancer Epidemiology Dashboard** - a tool that represents three years of meticulous work, thousands of patient records, and a vision to transform cancer care in East Africa.

As the **Research Data Manager** for this groundbreaking KEMRI project, I had the privilege of turning data into a weapon against one of healthcare's most persistent challenges: patients lost to follow-up.

## The Crisis We Uncovered

Our 10-year retrospective study at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) revealed a devastating reality:

::: {.warning-box}
### The Stark Statistics

- **59% of cancer patients** Lost To Follow-Up (LTFU) within the **first year** of care
- **5-year survival rate: just 9%**
- **3,438 patients analyzed** (2013-2023)
- **Over half disappeared** from care, leaving treatment incomplete and outcomes uncertain
- **Advanced-stage diagnosis** was the norm, not the exception
:::

These numbers weren't just statistics - they represented mothers, fathers, daughters, sons. People like Davin Adhiambo, who battled stage one uterine cancer, temporarily losing her sight and mobility, but who fought back to recovery.

Every percentage point represented a life that could be saved with better tracking, timely interventions, and data-driven care.

## A Story of Triumph: Davin Adhiambo

During the Cancer Survivor's Day celebrations, I met **Davin Adhiambo**, whose journey epitomizes why this work matters.

Diagnosed with stage one uterine cancer seven months earlier, Davin experienced:
- Temporary **blindness**
- **Paralysis** during treatment
- Fear and uncertainty

But through the specialized care at JOOTRH - the same hospital our dashboard serves - her sight and mobility were restored.

::: {.success-box}
**"I used to say cancer ni ugonjwa mbaya (cancer is a bad disease). But I've overcome my fears and gained courage through this experience."**

Today, her cancer has been reduced to **1%**. She's studying at Migosi Institute of Science and Technology, dreaming of becoming a social worker.

**This is what data-driven care can achieve.**
:::

Stories like Davin's fuel my passion for health data science. Every chart I abstracted, every line of code I wrote, every validation rule I implemented - it was all for people like her.

## Technical Deep Dive: The Dashboard Features

### For the Data Science Community

If you're building similar healthcare tools, here's what we implemented:

#### 1. Patient Tracking Module
```python
# Sample HFC code for LTFU detection
def flag_ltfu_risk(patient_df):
    """
    Identifies patients at risk of loss to follow-up
    based on appointment adherence patterns
    """
    # Calculate days since last visit
    patient_df['days_since_visit'] = (
        pd.Timestamp.now() - patient_df['last_visit_date']
    ).dt.days
    
    # Flag based on cancer type-specific thresholds
    thresholds = {
        'breast': 60,
        'cervical': 45,
        'prostate': 90,
        'esophageal': 30
    }
    
    patient_df['ltfu_risk'] = patient_df.apply(
        lambda row: row['days_since_visit'] > 
        thresholds.get(row['cancer_type'], 60),
        axis=1
    )
    
    return patient_df[patient_df['ltfu_risk']]
```

#### 2. Survival Analysis
- **Kaplan-Meier curves** by cancer type and stage
- **Cox proportional hazards** modeling for risk factors
- **Competing risks analysis** (death vs LTFU)

#### 3. Dashboard Performance
- **Query optimization** for real-time updates
- **Data caching** for frequently accessed views
- **Role-based access** for data security
- **Mobile-responsive** design for field use

## Why This Matters: The Bigger Picture

Cancer doesn't discriminate. But access to quality, sustained care often does.

In resource-limited settings like Kisumu County, the difference between life and death often comes down to:
- **Early detection** (too many present at advanced stages)
- **Treatment adherence** (59% lost in first year)
- **Follow-up care** (48% of breast cancer patients never return)

**Data can change this equation.**

By making the invisible visible - by tracking every patient, flagging every missed appointment, understanding every barrier to care - we can:

1. **Save lives** through early intervention
2. **Optimize resources** by understanding true needs
3. **Inform policy** with evidence-based insights
4. **Build systems** that don't let people fall through cracks

This is the promise of **health data science**.

## Final Thoughts

Three years ago, this was just an idea: *"What if we could see every cancer patient's journey in real-time?"*

Today, it's reality. A dashboard running at JOOTRH, helping clinicians save lives.

But the real measure of success won't be in the technology we built or the papers we publish. It will be in:

- The mother who **doesn't** get lost to follow-up because we flagged her risk
- The patient who gets **early intervention** because we caught stage progression
- The healthcare system that **allocates resources** based on data, not guesswork
- The survival rates that **climb** from 9% toward something better

**This is why I do health data science.**

**This is why data matters.**

**This is what impact looks like.**
