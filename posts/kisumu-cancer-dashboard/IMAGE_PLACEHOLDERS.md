   - Draw.io (free)
   - Figma (free)

2. **Use screenshots** from:
   - Tableau dashboard (anonymized)
   - R/Python analysis outputs
   - REDCap interface (demo mode)

3. **Design infographics** showing:

## Temporary Solution

Until you have actual images, you can:

1. Remove the image references from the .qmd file
2. Add placeholder alt text
3. Or use generic medical/data science stock images (properly attributed)

## Example Code for Images

```markdown
![Dashboard launch with Governor Nyong'o and research team](dashboard-launch.jpg)
```

If image doesn't exist yet, blog will still render without it (broken image icon).
