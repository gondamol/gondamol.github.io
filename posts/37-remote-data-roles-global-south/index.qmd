## The Reality of Remote Data Work

Remote roles are competitive—but it’s not impossible from the Global South.

Challenges:

- Time zones
- Payment logistics
- Perception gaps about universities and institutions

Advantages:

- You understand **low- and middle-income contexts** better than most
- You can work with **local data and international methods**

## What International Teams Actually Look For

- Reliable communication
- Documentation and reproducible work
- Ability to work with messy, real-world data
- Some overlap in working hours

Stack doesn’t need to be fancy:

- SQL + R/Python + one BI tool
- GitHub for code and portfolio

## How to Be Discoverable

- Fix your LinkedIn:
  - Headline: “Health Data Analyst | M&amp;E | R + SQL”
  - About: 3–4 bullet points focusing on outcomes you’ve driven
  - Featured: link to 2–3 portfolio projects
- Use GitHub:
  - Host small, polished projects
  - Add READMEs that explain context and methods

## Where to Look for Remote Roles

- International NGOs and research labs
- Remote-first companies (analytics consultancies, SaaS)
- Fellowships and fellow-like roles

Look for:

- “Anywhere” or “Global” location tags
- Strong emphasis on writing and async collaboration

## How to Pitch Yourself

Instead of:

> “I’m a data analyst from [country], looking for opportunities.”

Try:

> “I design and automate data workflows for health and evaluation projects in low-resource settings. I’ve built dashboards used by X facilities and helped reduce reporting time by Y%.”

Your location is not a weakness if you pair it with a **strong, context-aware portfolio**.
