## Why R Is a Secret Weapon for M&amp;E

Most M&amp;E teams live in:

- Excel
- SPSS or Stata
- Manually updated Word/PDF reports

R lets you:

- Clean data reproducibly
- Reuse scripts across projects
- Generate entire reports with **one command**

## 7 High-Impact Workflows

1. **Automated Cleaning of Survey Data**
   - Handle missing values
   - Recode factors
   - Detect outliers

2. **Indicator Calculation**
   - Coverage, quality, equity indicators
   - By district/facility/age/sex

3. **Data Quality Dashboards**
   - Missingness, duplicates, logical checks

4. **Monitoring Dashboards**
   - Monthly or quarterly indicator updates

5. **Impact Analysis**
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Difference-in-differences

6. **Reproducible Reports**
   - Quarto reports by country/partner

7. **Small Simulation Studies**
   - Sample size sensitivity
   - Scenario planning

## Example: From Kobo Export to Clean Dataset

Conceptually:

1. Read raw CSV from Kobo into R
2. Clean variable names and types
3. Recode key variables (e.g., facility IDs, districts)
4. Save a versioned clean file into `data/clean/`

If you can turn **messy raw exports into clean analysis-ready data** with one script, you become extremely valuable.

## How to Learn R for M&amp;E Quickly

- Start with:
  - `tidyverse` for data wrangling
  - `janitor` for quick cleaning
  - `readr` for imports
- Practice on:
  - DHS, MICS, or other public health datasets
  - Your own anonymized program data (if allowed)

Focus on **real workflows**, not isolated functions.
