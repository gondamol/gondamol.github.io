## SQL Interview Questions

### **Q1: What's the difference between WHERE and HAVING?**

**Answer:**
- **WHERE:** Filters rows BEFORE grouping
- **HAVING:** Filters groups AFTER aggregation

**Example:**
```sql
-- WHERE filters individual rows
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000  -- Filter individuals
GROUP BY department;

-- HAVING filters aggregated results
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 70000;  -- Filter groups
```

### **Q2: Explain different types of JOINs**

**Answer:**
- **INNER JOIN:** Only matching rows from both tables
- **LEFT JOIN:** All from left table + matches from right
- **RIGHT JOIN:** All from right table + matches from left  
- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** All rows from both tables

**When to use:**
- INNER: Find customers who placed orders
- LEFT: Find all customers (including those with no orders)
- FULL OUTER: Rarely used, mostly for data audits

### **Q3: Write a query to find the 2nd highest salary**

**Answer:**
```sql
-- Method 1: Using LIMIT/OFFSET
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

-- Method 2: Using subquery
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

-- Method 3: Using window function (best)
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rnk
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE rnk = 2;
```

## Python Interview Questions

### **Q4: What's the difference between a list and a tuple?**

**Answer:**
- **List:** Mutable (can change), uses `[]`
- **Tuple:** Immutable (cannot change), uses `()`

**Example:**
```python
# List - can modify
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 10  # Works

# Tuple - cannot modify  
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple[0] = 10  # Error!

# When to use tuple:
# - Fixed data (days of week, coordinates)
# - Dictionary keys (must be immutable)
# - Faster than lists
```

### **Q5: Explain how you would remove duplicates from a pandas DataFrame**

**Answer:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Remove all duplicates
df_clean = df.drop_duplicates()

# Remove duplicates based on specific columns
df_clean = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['customer_id'])

# Keep last occurrence instead of first
df_clean = df.drop_duplicates(keep='last')

# Before removal, check how many
print(f"Duplicates: {df.duplicated().sum()}")
```

## Statistics Interview Questions

### **Q6: Explain p-value in simple terms**

**Answer:**
"A p-value is the probability of observing results at least as extreme as what we got, if there really is no effect.

Example: We test a new ad campaign. P-value = 0.03 means there's only a 3% chance these results happened by random luck if the campaign doesn't actually work.

Since 3% is less than our threshold (usually 5%), we conclude the campaign likely does work."

### **Q7: When would you use median instead of mean?**

**Answer:**
"Use median when data is skewed or has outliers, because median isn't affected by extreme values.

**Example:**
House prices in a neighborhood:
- $200K, $210K, $205K, $215K, $5M (celebrity's house)
- Mean: $967K (misleading!)
- Median: $210K (representative)

**Use cases:** Salaries, house prices, customer spending"

---

### **Q8: What's the difference between Type I and Type II error?**

**Answer:**
- **Type I (False Positive):** Saying there's an effect when there isn't
- **Type II (False Negative):** Missing a real effect

**Medical Test Analogy:**
- Type I: Test says you're sick, but you're healthy
- Type II: Test says you're healthy, but you're sick

**Business Example:**
- Type I: Launching a useless feature thinking it's good
- Type II: Rejecting a good feature thinking it's useless"

## Behavioral Questions

### **Q12: Tell me about a time you made a mistake in your analysis**

**Answer using STAR method:**

**Situation:** "In my previous role, I was analyzing customer churn..."

**Task:** "I needed to calculate monthly retention rate..."

**Action:** "I initially calculated retention incorrectly by [specific error]. When my manager questioned the numbers, I realized my mistake. I immediately:
1. Acknowledged the error
2. Redid the analysis correctly
3. Documented the issue to prevent future mistakes
4. Created a checklist for similar analyses"

**Result:** "The correct analysis showed retention was actually 5% lower than reported, which led to earlier intervention and prevented further losses. I learned to always have someone peer-review my work and to create validation checks."

### **Q13: Describe a time you had to explain technical results to non-technical stakeholders**

**Answer:**
"I once needed to present a machine learning model's churn prediction to the CEO.

**Challenge:** CEO wanted to know 'how it works' but had no ML background.

**Approach:**
1. Used analogy: 'Like how Netflix recommends shows based on similar users, our model predicts churn based on patterns from past churners'
2. Showed business impact first: '85% accuracy means we can save $500K annually'
3. Used visualizations instead of math
4. Prepared for 'what if' questions with interactive dashboard

**Result:** Got approval to implement, and CEO became advocate for data-driven decisions."

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Quick checks
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())
print(df.head())
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

**Minutes 5-10: Clean data**

# Handle missing values
# Remove duplicates
# Fix data types
```

**Minutes 10-20: Explore & visualize**
```python
# Key distributions
# Correlations
# Trends over time
# Comparisons across categories
```

**Minutes 20-25: Find 3 insights**
- Make them specific and actionable
- Quantify the impact
