# **The Human Behind the Data**

*"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."* - Friedrich Nietzsche
:::

## **🏛️ Philosophy & Spiritual Practice** {data-aos="fade-up"}

### Stoic Discipline

I practice **Stoic philosophy religiously**. Not as an intellectual exercise, but as a daily framework for living with:

- **Emotional resilience** when facing life's inevitable challenges
- **Rational thinking** in decision-making and problem-solving
- **Virtue ethics** guiding every action
- ***Memento mori*** - remembering mortality to live fully present

::: {.info-box}
**Daily Practice:**

- Morning reading of *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius
- Evening reflection on Stoic principles
- Journaling on virtue, wisdom, justice, courage
- Applying philosophical wisdom to modern data work
:::

### Integrated Spirituality

My spiritual life honors multiple traditions:

::: {.highlight-box}
**Ancestral Reverence** - I honor the **gods of my ancestors** (African traditional spirituality), staying connected to my roots and cultural heritage.

**Christian Faith** - I follow **Christ Jesus**, finding profound wisdom in His teachings on compassion, service, and love.

**Buddhist Morality** - I deeply respect **Buddhist approaches to morality** - mindfulness, compassion, non-attachment. *I would call myself a Buddha* in the sense of seeking enlightenment through daily practice and ethical living.

**"The religions of my ancestors, the teachings of Christ, and the wisdom of the Buddha all point toward the same truth: live with integrity, serve others, cultivate inner peace."**

## **📚 Reading & Intellectual Life** {data-aos="fade-up"}

### Currently Reading

::: {.success-box}
**📖 Meditations** by Marcus Aurelius

My constant companion. I read this daily, returning to its wisdom for guidance on resilience, duty, and rational living. Every page reminds me that obstacles are opportunities, that we control only our responses, not external events.

## **🐄 Farm Life & Nature** {data-aos="fade-up"}

The farm is my sanctuary - where philosophical principles meet practical living.

::: {.highlight-box}
**Why farming matters:**

- **Grounding** - Connects me to ancestral traditions and the earth
- **Stoic practice** - Accepting what nature provides, working with seasons
- **Mindfulness** - Present moment awareness while tending animals
- **Simplicity** - Finding joy in watching goats eat grass 🐐
- **Resilience** - Learning from crop failures and livestock challenges
:::

---

## **💪 Physical Discipline** {data-aos="fade-up"}

### Fitness Practice

A strong body supports a disciplined mind:

::: {.info-box}
**Training Regimen:**

- **Morning workouts** (5-6 days/week) - Start each day with physical discipline
- **Strength training** - Building resilience through progressive overload
- **Running** - Meditative movement, connecting mind and body
- **Yoga/stretching** - Flexibility, balance, presence

**Philosophy:** *"No citizen has a right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. What a disgrace it is for a man to grow old without ever seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable."* - Socrates
:::

### Hydration Discipline

**Water is essential.** I drink significant amounts daily:

- 💧 **3-4 liters** minimum per day
- Mental clarity during long coding sessions
- Physical performance optimization
- Health maintenance
- *Simple, foundational, non-negotiable*

## **⚖️ Core Values** {data-aos="fade-up"}

### Integrity & Truthfulness

::: {.success-box}
**Truth above comfort.**

I speak honestly even when it's difficult. Research demands truthfulness - in data, in reporting, in acknowledging limitations. This extends to every area of life.

- Transparent about mistakes and learnings
- Honest in all professional dealings
- Authentic voice, not performative
- *"The truth will set you free"* - living this daily
:::

### Civic Engagement

::: {.info-box}
**Data for the public good.**

My work serves communities:

- Research on **low-income household financial behavior** → informs policy
- Building **open source tools** → reduces barriers in African research
- Training **500+ researchers** → multiplies impact through capacity building
- **Democratic participation** → using data for transparent governance
- **Community projects** → direct service to vulnerable populations

*Not just talking about impact - creating it through action.*
:::

## **🤝 The Collaborative Builder** {data-aos="fade-up"}

My work demonstrates team-player qualities through action:

### Multi-Country Research Coordination

- Led data collection across **Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania**
- Coordinated teams at **1,535+ sites**
- Managed **cross-functional partnerships** (Georgetown gui2de, University of Alaska)

### Capacity Building at Scale

- **Trained 500+ researchers** in data management and M&E
- Developed **training protocols** used across institutions
- **Mentored** aspiring data scientists and analysts

### Field Team Leadership

- Recruited, trained, and supervised **50+ field enumerators**
- Created **collaborative field cultures**
- Problem-solved together through challenges

### Open Source Contribution

- Building **surveyKE** as open collaboration
- Sharing **code on GitHub**
- Inviting **community participation**

*These actions speak louder than any claim of "being a team player."*

## **🌟 Why This Matters** {data-aos="fade-up"}

::: {.warning-box}
**Philosophy isn't abstract - it's lived.**

Every line of code I write, every dataset I analyze, every person I train - it's all guided by:

- **Stoic discipline** → Resilience through challenges
- **Ancestral wisdom** → Staying grounded in identity
- **Christian compassion** → Service to others
- **Buddhist mindfulness** → Present, intentional action
- **Nietzschean strength** → Creating meaning, becoming who I am

This is who I am. Not just a data scientist, but a philosopher-practitioner building tools that serve humanity while living with integrity, discipline, and purpose.
