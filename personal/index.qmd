## The Human Behind the Data

> "He who has a why to live can bear almost any how." Friedrich Nietzsche

I am a data professional, and I am also a person shaped by philosophy, spiritual reflection, farming, training, and community work. These practices help me stay grounded, especially when research work becomes complex.

## Philosophy and Spiritual Practice

### Stoic Discipline

Stoic thought is part of my daily structure. It helps me stay calm, think clearly, and focus on what I can control.

My daily Stoic practice includes:

1. Morning reading from *Meditations*.
2. Evening reflection on choices, character, and duty.
3. Journaling around wisdom, justice, courage, and self control.

### Integrated Spirituality

My spiritual life brings together multiple streams of wisdom.

1. Ancestral reverence, to stay connected to identity and heritage.
2. Christian faith, with emphasis on compassion, service, and love.
3. Buddhist morality, with mindfulness, non attachment, and ethical presence.

I see these paths as complementary ways of living with integrity and inner peace.

## Reading and Intellectual Life

### Current Anchor Text

I read *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius consistently. It keeps my mind clear during hard periods and reminds me to treat obstacles as training.

### Core Reading Themes

1. Stoic classics by Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus.
2. Nietzsche, especially his work on meaning, courage, and self creation.
3. Buddhist texts focused on compassion, discipline, and awareness.

## Farm Life and Nature

The farm in Homa Bay is where theory meets reality. It keeps my analysis honest. When I work on food systems, risk, and cash flow, I am not writing from distance. I am writing from lived experience.

## Physical Discipline

Physical training keeps my mind stable and focused. I train most mornings, and I use movement to reset and think clearly.

My fitness rhythm includes:

1. Strength sessions across the week.
2. Running and active recovery.
3. Hydration discipline, usually 3 to 4 liters per day.

## The Collaborative Builder

I value execution with people, not in isolation. Most of my best outcomes came from cross functional collaboration.

1. Multi country coordination across Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda.
2. Team leadership for field operations and data quality.
3. Training and mentorship for analysts and enumerators.
4. Open source sharing for tools and workflows.

## Building for Impact

I am learning AI assisted development to build practical tools in public.

1. Health tools for data collection and monitoring.
2. Climate and agriculture tools for adaptation and planning.
3. Civic and governance tools for transparency and accountability.
4. Personal growth tools rooted in discipline and reflection.

## Core Values

1. Integrity and truthfulness, even when truth is uncomfortable.
2. Service and compassion, especially for low resource communities.
3. Discipline, in both technical work and personal habits.
4. Civic contribution through open tools and evidence led action.

## Daily Rhythm

**Morning**
Read, train, plan, and set the tone for the day.

**Deep work block**
Research analysis, coding, writing, and model building.

**Afternoon**
Collaboration, meetings, field coordination, and learning.

**Evening**
Reflection, reading, family time, and reset.

## Why This Matters

Philosophy is not abstract for me. It is practical. It guides how I write code, manage data, train teams, and make decisions. This is how I keep my work useful, humane, and accountable.

## Connect on Shared Values

If you care about research quality, open collaboration, practical software for Africa, or disciplined long term work, I am open to connect.
