## Abstract {#abstract}

**Background:** Non communicable diseases, especially hypertension and diabetes, account for a substantial share of mortality in Kenya. Despite health service devolution to county governments since 2013, financing for chronic care at the primary health care level remains weak. This study examined financial determinants shaping hypertension and diabetes care in rural Kisumu County.

**Methods:** The study used a convergent parallel mixed methods cross sectional design in seven public primary health care facilities in Seme Sub County. Quantitative data came from structured questionnaires and retrospective financial record review for January to August 2024. Qualitative data came from in depth interviews with facility in charges. Quantitative analysis used descriptive statistics in STATA v16 and qualitative analysis used thematic coding in R.

**Results:** All seven facilities prepared annual workplans and budgets, but none achieved comprehensive NCD specific planning with a dedicated NCD budget line. Most facilities depended on NHIF reimbursements and donor support, while few received direct county funding. All facilities had bank accounts, but none had full spending autonomy. County level expenditure approval often took weeks to months, limiting timely local procurement during stockouts. Frequent medicine stockouts were reported by 85.7 percent of facilities.

**Conclusion:** Facility level financing constraints are strongly linked to weaker chronic disease service continuity in rural primary care. Strengthening facility spending autonomy, ring fencing NCD budgets, diversifying financing, and speeding disbursement and emergency procurement are critical for effective and equitable chronic care delivery under UHC.

## Recommendations {#recommendations}

1. Establish ring fenced NCD budget lines at facility planning level with protected execution rules.
2. Expand facility level spending autonomy for approved essential NCD medicines and diagnostics.
3. Introduce faster county disbursement and emergency procurement pathways for critical stockout risk periods.
4. Diversify and stabilize financing sources beyond reimbursement and donor dependent channels.
5. Build routine facility financing dashboards that track budget release, expenditure cycle time, stockout days, and refill reliability.
6. Institutionalize quarterly county facility review forums linking financial performance to NCD service outcomes.
