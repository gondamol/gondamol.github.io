# Background & Context

---

## The NCD Crisis in Kenya {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
*   **Rising Burden:** NCDs account for **27% of deaths** in Kenya.
*   **Prevalence:**
    *   **26%** of adults have elevated blood pressure.
    *   **5.6%** have raised blood glucose.
*   **The Challenge:** Effective management requires *sustained* access to medicines and monitoring.
*   **The Gap:** Despite devolution (2013), financing for NCDs at Primary Health Care (PHC) level remains weak.
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Key Statistic
Cardiovascular diseases are now responsible for over **27%** of all deaths in Kenya, surpassing many communicable diseases.

## Problem Statement

::: {style="background-color: #ebf8ff; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #2b6cb0;"}
**Despite the availability of PHC facilities in Kisumu County, hypertension and diabetes control rates remain suboptimal.**

Financing is a critical input, yet we lack specific evidence on how **facility-level financing mechanisms** (sources, budgeting, autonomy) directly influence NCD service delivery in rural devolved systems.

<br>

### Study Aim
To examine the **financial determinants** shaping hypertension and diabetes care in PHC facilities within Seme Sub-County.

---

# Methodology

---

## Study Design & Setting {.smaller}

*   **Design:** Convergent parallel **mixed-methods cross-sectional study**.
*   **Setting:** Seme Sub-County, Kisumu, Kenya.
*   **Population:** **7 Public PHC Facilities** (Levels 2–4).
    *   *Selection:* Purposive sampling of facilities providing NCD services.
*   **Data Collection (Jan–Aug 2024):**
    *   **Quantitative:** Structured questionnaires, retrospective financial record review.
    *   **Qualitative:** In-depth interviews with facility in-charges.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
## Conceptual Framework
Guided by the **WHO Health Financing Framework**, analyzing:
1. Sources of Financing
2. Planning & Budgeting
3. Resource Allocation
4. Financial Autonomy
:::

# Results

---

## 1. Funding Sources: Narrow & Unstable {.smaller}

Facilities rely on a limited mix of funding, creating vulnerability.

| Source | % of Facilities (n=7) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NHIF Reimbursements** | **71.4%** (n=5) |
| **Donor Support (Danida)** | **71.4%** (n=5) |
| **Direct County Funding** | **28.6%** (n=2) |
| **User Fees** | **28.6%** (n=2) |

::: {.fragment}
> "We cannot specifically say this money is for NCDs. It’s all pooled for many competing needs."  
> — *Facility In-charge, Level 3*
:::

::: {.fragment}
*   **57.1%** of facilities relied on only **two** funding streams.
*   NHIF reimbursements faced delays of **2–4 months**.
:::

---

## 2. Planning & Budgeting: "Ritual Planning" {.smaller}

*   **100%** of facilities prepared annual workplans and budgets.
*   **0%** achieved **comprehensive NCD-specific planning** (Workplan + Budget + Dedicated NCD Line).
*   Budgets were described as "aspirational wish lists" rather than operational tools.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Reality:**
*   "Bottom-up" budgeting exists in theory but not practice.
*   Allocations rarely match requests.
*   No ring-fenced funds for NCDs.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
> "We budget but it's not actualized. These are just wish lists because the money is not enough to implement what we plan."  
> — *In-charge, Level 2*
:::
:::

---

## 3. Financial Autonomy: The "Triple Constraint" {.smaller}

**Recentralization of Authority:**
Despite having bank accounts, **100%** of facilities required county-level approval for expenditures.

*   **Approval Delays:**
    *   3–4 Weeks: **57.1%**
    *   > 2 Months: **28.6%**

::: {.alert style="background-color: #fff5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; color: #c53030;"}
**Consequence:** Facilities cannot procure medicines locally during central supply stockouts.
:::

> "When KEMSA doesn't supply... we can't act fast. We have to wait for county approval and by then there's a stockout."  
> — *In-charge, Level 2*

---

## 4. Impact: Medication Stockouts {.smaller}

The lack of autonomy and unstable funding leads to frequent shortages.

*   **85.7% (n=6)** reported **frequent or very frequent** stockouts of NCD medicines.
*   **42.9%** reported stockouts "almost always".

**Clinical Consequences:**
1.  **Disease Progression:** Patients present with complications (strokes, kidney issues).
2.  **Loss of Trust:** Patients abandon treatment or seek care elsewhere.
3.  **Staff Demoralization:** Health workers feel helpless without tools.

> "The moment that there are no drugs there are complications... Some try to manage without, which is dangerous."

---

# Conclusions & Recommendations

---

## Key Conclusions

1.  **Severe Financial Constraints:** PHC facilities operate with narrow, unpredictable funding that undermines chronic care.
2.  **Lack of Autonomy:** Centralized approval processes (taking weeks/months) prevent timely response to stockouts.
3.  **No NCD Prioritization:** Lack of ring-fenced budgets means NCDs lose out to competing priorities.
4.  **Systemic Failure:** The current architecture fails to deliver the "effectiveness" and "efficiency" promised by devolution and UHC policies.

---

## Recommendations {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**1. Strengthen Financial Autonomy**
*   Allow facilities to retain/spend funds at source for emergencies.
*   Streamline approval processes (digital systems).

**2. Ring-Fence NCD Funds**
*   Mandatory NCD budget lines in county/facility budgets.
*   Allocations proportionate to disease burden.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**3. Diversify Financing**
*   Reduce reliance on donors/NHIF.
*   Ensure timely NHIF/SHA reimbursements.

**4. Emergency Procurement**
*   Establish facility-level revolving funds for stockouts.
