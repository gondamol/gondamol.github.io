# Background & Context

---

## The Global NCD Crisis {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
- **71% of global deaths** are from NCDs (WHO, 2023)
- **Hypertension**: Affects 1.28 billion adults worldwide
- **Diabetes**: 537 million adults (IDF, 2021)
- **Africa's burden**: Fastest growing NCD epidemic
- **Kenya context**: 
  - 24.5% adults have hypertension
  - 3.3% have diabetes
  - **Kisumu County**: Above-average prevalence
:::

::: {.notes}
Start with the big picture - NCDs are the leading cause of death globally. Africa's epidemic is growing faster than other regions.

## The Financial Challenge {.smaller background-color="#f7fafc"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Out-of-Pocket Costs

- Consultations: KES 100-500
- Medications (monthly):
  - Hypertension: KES 500-2,000
  - Diabetes: KES 1,500-5,000
- Complications: KES 10,000+
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Low-Income Reality

- Average daily income: < KES 200
- Household size: 4-6 people
- Healthcare: 5-10% of income
- **Result**: Catastrophic spending
:::

## Gaps in Current Knowledge {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
**What we know:**
- Financial barriers exist
- Medication adherence is poor
- NCDs are rising in Kenya

**What we DON'T know:**
- **Specific financial determinants** of effective management
- **Threshold effects**: How much is enough?
- **Household financial coping strategies**
- **Which interventions** are most cost-effective

# Research Problem

---

## Problem Statement {background-color="#ebf8ff"}

::: {style="font-size: 1.2em; padding: 2rem;"}
Despite availability of primary healthcare facilities in Kisumu County, **hypertension and diabetes control rates remain suboptimal** (< 30% controlled).

**Central Question:**

> To what extent do **household financial factors** determine effective disease management among patients attending primary health facilities?
:::

---

## Research Questions {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
1. What is the **prevalence of controlled vs. uncontrolled** hypertension and diabetes in Kisumu primary facilities?

2. What are the **household financial characteristics** of patients with NCDs?

3. Which **specific financial factors** (income, expenditure, savings, health spending) are associated with disease control?

4. What **financial coping strategies** do households employ?

5. What is the **relationship between financial protection mechanisms** (insurance, subsidies) and health outcomes?
:::

---

## Research Objectives {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Main Objective

**To explore the financial determinants of effective hypertension and diabetes management** among patients attending primary health facilities in Kisumu County.

### Specific Objectives

1. Determine prevalence of controlled disease
2. Characterize household financial profiles
3. Identify key financial predictors of control
4. Document financial coping strategies
5. Assess impact of financial protection mechanisms
6. Develop recommendations for policy

## Study Design {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Cross-sectional analytical study**

**Setting:**

- Kisumu County, Kenya
- Urban & rural mix

**Population:**
- Adults 18+ years
- Diagnosed hypertension/diabetes

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Data Collection:**

:::
:::

---

## Sample Size Calculation {.smaller}

::: {style="background-color: #f7fafc; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 10px;"}
**Formula:** 
$$n = \frac{Z^2 \times p(1-p)}{d^2}$$

Where:
- Z = 1.96 (95% CI)
- p = 0.30 (expected control rate)
- d = 0.05 (precision)

**Calculation:**
$$n = \frac{1.96^2 \times 0.30(0.70)}{0.05^2} = 323$$

**With 10% non-response:** **n = 355**
:::

## Preliminary Findings: Coping Strategies {.smaller background-color="#f7fafc"}

**How households cope with NCD costs (qualitative themes):**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Medication rationing** - "I take one pill instead of two when money is tight"
2. **Treatment delays** - "I wait until I feel really sick before going to the clinic"
3. **Borrowing** - "I borrow from friends, family, or chamas monthly"
4. **Asset sales** - "I sold my chickens to pay for my mother's medication"
5. **Income diversification** - "I do casual work on weekends to cover health costs"
6. **Dietary compromises** - "I can't afford the recommended diet - I eat what I can"
:::

# Discussion

---

## Key Insights {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
**1. Financial barriers are CRITICAL**
- 72% cannot afford medications consistently
- 68% experience catastrophic health spending
- Strong association between income and disease control (preliminary analysis)

**2. Current financing mechanisms are inadequate**
- NHIF coverage: Only 28% enrolled
- Of those enrolled: 62% still face significant out-of-pocket costs
- Subsidies: Limited awareness and accessibility

**3. Household coping strategies are unsustainable**
- Borrowing creates debt cycles
- Asset sales erode household resilience
- Treatment rationing worsens health outcomes
:::

---

## Comparison with Literature {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Global Context

**Similar findings worldwide:**

- Philippines: 31% hypertension control, cost main barrier (Sy et al., 2020)
- Bangladesh: 18% diabetes control, financial hardship in 65% (Khan et al., 2019)
- Sub-Saharan Africa: 7-20% hypertension control (Guwatudde et al., 2015)

**Our findings align:** Financial barriers are a universal challenge in low-resource settings.

### Kenya Specific

**Consistent with national data:**

- STEPS Survey 2015: 15% hypertension control
- STEPwise Survey 2021: Slight improvement but still <30%
- Urban-rural disparities persist

**Our contribution:** First detailed financial diary study in Kenya's NCD context.

### Novel Contributions

**What's new:**

1. Granular 30-day financial diaries (not just surveys)
2. Linking financial data with clinical outcomes
3. Mixed-methods approach capturing coping narratives
4. Focus on PRIMARY care (not hospital-based)

:::

---

## Policy Implications {.smaller background-color="#ebf8ff"}

**Based on preliminary findings, we recommend:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Expand financial protection**
   - Universal health coverage for NCDs
   - Subsidized medication programs
   - Voucher systems for the poorest

2. **Reduce direct costs**
   - Free/subsidized medications at public facilities
   - Elimination of consultation fees for chronic conditions
   - Community-based distribution programs

3. **Income support**
   - Social cash transfers for NCD patients
   - Conditional cash transfers linked to adherence
   - Livelihood support programs

4. **Health insurance reforms**
   - Mandatory NCD coverage in NHIF/SHA
   - Reduced premiums for chronic patients
   - Elimination of co-payments for essential NCD drugs

## Study Limitations {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Design Limitations:**

- Cross-sectional (cannot establish causality)
- Single county (generalizability?)
- Facility-based (excludes those not in care)
- 30-day diaries (seasonal variations?)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Mitigating Strategies:**

- Robust sample size
- Mixed methods for triangulation
- Sensitivity analyses
- Comparison with national data
- Clear acknowledgment of limitations
:::

# Conclusions

2. **Financial barriers are the PRIMARY determinant** of poor disease management
   - 72% cannot afford consistent medication
   - 68% experience catastrophic spending
   - Coping strategies are harmful and unsustainable

3. **Current financial protection mechanisms are inadequate**
   - Low insurance coverage
   - High out-of-pocket costs even among insured
