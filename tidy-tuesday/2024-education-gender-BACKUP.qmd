## 🎯 UN SDG Alignment

::: {.callout-important}
## SDG 4: Quality Education

**Target 4.1**: By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education.

**Target 4.5**: By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education.

This analysis examines global education access using student-teacher ratios and enrollment data from UNESCO.

## 📈 Global Education Trends

### 1. Enrollment Rates by Education Level

```{r enrollment-trends, fig.height=7}
education_data %>%
  group_by(year, level) %>%
  summarise(mean_enrollment = mean(enrollment_rate, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_enrollment, color = level, group = level)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 100, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray30") +
  scale_color_manual(values = education_colors) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(scale = 1), limits = c(0, 105)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2023, 3)) +
  labs(
    title = "Global Education Enrollment Rates by Level (2000-2023)",
    subtitle = "Average gross enrollment rates across all regions",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Gross Enrollment Rate (%)",
    color = "Education Level",

## 💡 Key Findings

::: {.callout-tip}
## Main Insights

1. **Primary Education Success**: Near-universal primary enrollment achieved globally, with gender parity in most regions.

2. **Secondary Education Gap**: Only ~75% global enrollment in secondary education, with significant regional disparities.

3. **Tertiary Education Reversal**: In many developed regions, women now outnumber men in higher education (GPI > 1.03).

4. **Persistent Challenges**: Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia still face significant gender gaps, especially in secondary and tertiary education.

5. **Quality Concerns**: High enrollment doesn't guarantee learning outcomes - many students complete primary school without basic literacy/numeracy.

## 🎯 Policy Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Remove Barriers to Girls' Education**
   - Eliminate school fees
   - Provide menstrual hygiene products
   - Build separate toilets for girls
   - Address child marriage and early pregnancy

2. **Improve Secondary Education Access**
   - Build more secondary schools in rural areas
   - Provide scholarships for disadvantaged students
   - Strengthen teacher training

3. **Focus on Quality**
   - Improve teacher-student ratios
   - Update curricula to include 21st-century skills
   - Strengthen assessment systems

### Long-term Strategies

4. **Address Root Causes**
   - Reduce poverty (families can't afford to send children to school)
   - Improve nutrition (hungry children can't learn)
   - Ensure safe school environments

5. **Promote STEM for Girls**
   - Challenge gender stereotypes
   - Provide female role models in STEM
   - Create girl-friendly STEM programs

6. **Lifelong Learning**
   - Expand vocational and technical education
   - Support adult literacy programs
   - Promote digital literacy
