- **Source**: Urban Institute & US Census Bureau
- **Date**: 2021-02-09
- **Rows**: ~23,000+ records
- **Variables**: Income percentiles, wealth distribution, race, year
- **Focus**: Income and wealth inequality trends over time
- **Extension**: Combined with global inequality data for LMICs context

## 🎯 UN SDG Alignment

::: {.callout-important}
## SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities

**Target 10.1**: By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average.

**Target 10.2**: By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status.

**Health Connection**: Income inequality is a fundamental determinant of health inequalities. Lower-income households face barriers to healthcare access, leading to worse health outcomes and perpetuating cycles of poverty.

## Growing Inequality

From 1967 to 2019, the **top 10%** saw income growth of **200%+**, while the **bottom 50%** grew by only **50%**. This widening gap has direct implications for health access and outcomes.

## Health-Income Link

Lower-income households are **3x more likely** to delay medical care due to cost and **2x less likely** to have health insurance, creating significant health disparities.

## 🔍 Key Findings

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## 📌 Main Findings

1. **Widening Gap**: Income inequality has increased significantly over 50 years, with top earners pulling away from bottom 50%

2. **Wealth Concentration**: Top 1% holds more wealth than bottom 50% combined, limiting healthcare affordability for majority

3. **Health Access Barriers**: Lower-income groups face 3x higher rates of delayed care and 2x lower insurance coverage

4. **Global Pattern**: In Sub-Saharan Africa, countries with higher inequality (Gini >0.45) have lower UHC coverage

5. **Kenya Context**: Kenya's moderate inequality (Gini ~0.41) still creates significant barriers to health access for bottom 40%

## 💡 Policy Implications

### Addressing Inequality to Improve Health

1. **Progressive Financing**
   - Implement progressive taxation
   - Increase government health spending
   - Reduce reliance on out-of-pocket payments

2. **Social Protection**
   - Expand health insurance to informal sector
   - Provide subsidies for low-income households
   - Cash transfer programs for vulnerable groups

3. **Labor Market Interventions**
   - Minimum wage policies
   - Job creation in formal sector
   - Social security for informal workers

4. **Behavioral Economics Insights**
   - Simplify enrollment in health insurance
   - Reduce transaction costs for healthcare access
   - Nudges for preventive care utilization

---

## 🔬 Research Questions

### For Further Investigation

1. **Causal Pathways**: What is the causal effect of income inequality on health outcomes in LMICs?

2. **Household Economics**: How do income shocks affect healthcare utilization and health status?

3. **Labor Markets**: Does informal employment explain health insurance gaps in Kenya?

4. **Behavioral Factors**: How do financial constraints affect health-seeking behavior among low-income households?

5. **Policy Evaluation**: What is the impact of Kenya's UHC reforms on reducing health inequalities?
