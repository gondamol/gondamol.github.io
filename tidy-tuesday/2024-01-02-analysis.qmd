# Global Temperature Changes

This week's Tidy Tuesday dataset focuses on global temperature changes over time. In this analysis, I explore the trends in global temperature increases and their potential implications on climate change.

## Data Preparation

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Generate random data
set.seed(123)  # Set seed for reproducibility

# Create a sequence of years from 1900 to 2024
years <- seq(1900, 2024)

# Generate random temperature changes, simulating a gradual increase over time
temperature_change <- cumsum(rnorm(length(years), mean = 0.02, sd = 0.1))

# Combine the years and temperature changes into a data frame
temperature_data <- data.frame(year = years, temperature_change = temperature_change)

# Preview the data
head(temperature_data)
```



```{r}
# Example plot
ggplot(temperature_data, aes(x = year, y = temperature_change)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Global Temperature Changes Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Temperature Change (Â°C)")
```
