## üìä Real TidyTuesday Dataset

::: {.callout-note}
## Dataset Information

This analysis uses the **Mental Health in Tech Survey** dataset from TidyTuesday Week 34, 2016.

- **Source**: Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) Survey  
- **Date**: 2016-08-16
- **Rows**: ~1,400 responses from tech workers globally
- **Variables**: Mental health conditions, treatment, workplace support, stigma
- **Focus**: Attitudes toward mental health in tech workplaces

## üéØ UN SDG & Labor Market Connection

::: {.callout-important}
## SDG 3.4 + SDG 8 (Decent Work)

**SDG 3.4**: Reduce premature mortality from NCDs and promote mental health  
**SDG 8.8**: Protect labor rights and promote safe working environments

**Research Connection**: Mental health workplace policies affect:
- Employee productivity & retention
- Health insurance utilization
- Treatment-seeking behavior
- Economic costs to employers & families

This connects to my health economics research on labor markets and health access.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è High Prevalence

**53%** of tech workers report experiencing depression and/or anxiety - significantly higher than general population rates (~7-10%).

**Why Tech?** High stress, long hours, job insecurity, isolation (especially remote work)

### üí∞ Economic Barriers

**Cost** (35%) and **insurance coverage** (15%) are the top barriers - totaling **50%** of reasons for not seeking treatment.

**Connection to my research**: Financial barriers to healthcare access, insurance coverage gaps, out-of-pocket expenditure burden.

## üîç Key Findings

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## üìå Summary

1. **High Prevalence**: 53% of tech workers report depression and/or anxiety

2. **Treatment Gap**: Only 48% of those with conditions sought treatment

3. **Financial Barriers**: Cost (35%) and insurance coverage (15%) are top barriers

4. **Company Size Matters**: Larger companies (1000+) provide better mental health support (70% vs 40% for small companies)

5. **Policy Impact**: Mental health benefits increase comfort discussing issues by 40%

6. **Global Variation**: High-income countries show better employer support and treatment-seeking rates

7. **Remote Work**: 35% work remotely - may increase isolation but also reduce stigma
:::

## üí° Policy & Research Implications

### For Tech Companies

1. **Expand Coverage**: Include mental health in all employee benefit packages
2. **Reduce Stigma**: Leadership should normalize mental health discussions
3. **Financial Support**: Cover therapy/counseling costs fully
4. **Flexible Work**: Allow mental health days and flexible scheduling
5. **Training**: Educate managers on mental health awareness

### For Policymakers

1. **Universal Coverage**: Mental health should be part of UHC
2. **Workplace Standards**: Mandate mental health support in labor laws
3. **Insurance Reform**: Eliminate cost barriers to mental health care
4. **Awareness Campaigns**: Reduce stigma at societal level

### Research Questions (PhD-Relevant)

1. **Causal Effect**: Does employer mental health support causally improve outcomes?
2. **Economic Costs**: What are productivity losses from untreated mental illness?
3. **Behavioral Economics**: How do nudges affect treatment-seeking?
4. **Labor Market**: How does mental health affect employment and earnings?
5. **LMICs Context**: What are mental health workplace policies in Kenya? Do informal sector workers have any support?

## üîó Connection to My Research

This analysis connects to my health economics interests in:

- **Labor Markets & Health**: Employment conditions affect health outcomes
- **Financial Barriers**: Out-of-pocket costs prevent care-seeking
- **Behavioral Economics**: Stigma and workplace culture influence decisions
- **Health Insurance**: Coverage gaps leave workers vulnerable
- **Informal Sector (Kenya)**: 80%+ of Kenyan workers lack employer health benefits - what are mental health implications?
