### ✅ Major Progress
Sub-Saharan Africa increased primary enrollment from **55%** (1990) to **88%** (2020) - huge achievement!

**Kenya**: Now at 88%, but quality and completion remain challenges.

### ⚠️ Drop-Off Crisis
- **Primary**: 88% enrolled
- **Secondary**: Only 55% continue (38% drop out!)
- **Tertiary**: Just 10% reach university

**Key Barrier**: Cost of secondary education, early marriage (girls), child labor

### 🎓 Gender Parity Achieved!
Kenya reached **0.99 gender parity** in primary education - equal girls and boys!

**Challenge**: Parity drops at secondary level (0.88) - girls drop out more.

```

::: {.callout-important}
### 💡 Strong Correlation
**10% increase** in female secondary education → **~40% reduction** in maternal mortality.

**Mechanism**: Education → delayed marriage → family planning → antenatal care → better outcomes

## 🔍 Key Findings

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## 📌 Summary

1. **Universal Primary**: Sub-Saharan Africa nearly achieved universal primary enrollment (88%)
2. **Secondary Gap**: Only 55% of Kenyan children complete secondary school
3. **Gender Parity**: Achieved in primary (0.99), but girls drop out more at secondary
4. **Education-Health**: Strong link - more female education = better maternal/child health
5. **Quality Crisis**: Enrollment up, but learning outcomes poor (not captured here)
6. **Tertiary Access**: Only 10% reach university in Kenya vs 65% in high-income countries
7. **Cost Barrier**: Secondary school fees are major barrier for poor families
:::

---

## 💡 Policy & Research Implications

### For Kenya
1. **Free Secondary**: Expand free education to secondary level
2. **Scholarships**: Target girls in secondary school
3. **Quality Focus**: Shift from access to learning outcomes
4. **Retention**: Programs to prevent drop-outs (e.g., school feeding)
5. **TVET**: Expand technical/vocational training

### Education-Health Connection
1. **Maternal Education**: Key intervention for child health
2. **Health Literacy**: School-based health education
3. **Early Childhood**: Invest in pre-primary (foundation)
4. **Integration**: Link education and health services

### Research Questions (PhD-Relevant)
1. **Causal Effect**: Does free secondary education improve health outcomes?
2. **Conditional Cash Transfers**: Do they reduce drop-outs and improve health?
3. **Quality vs Access**: Which matters more for health literacy?
4. **Gender**: Why do girls drop out at secondary level? How to prevent?
5. **Behavioral Economics**: How to nudge parents to keep girls in school?
