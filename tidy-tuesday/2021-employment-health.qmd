## üìä Real TidyTuesday Dataset

::: {.callout-note}
## Dataset Information

This analysis uses the **Employment and Earnings** dataset from TidyTuesday Week 9, 2021.

- **Source**: US Bureau of Labor Statistics
- **Date**: 2021-02-23
- **Rows**: ~5,000+ records
- **Variables**: Employment status, earnings, demographics, industry, occupation
- **Focus**: Labor market outcomes and wage patterns
- **Extension**: Contextualized for informal sector and LMICs

## üéØ UN SDG Alignment

::: {.callout-important}
## SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

**Target 8.5**: Achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all, including equal pay for equal value work.

**Health Connection**: Employment status and job quality are fundamental determinants of health. Informal employment often lacks health insurance and social protection.

**Kenya Context**: Over 80% of Kenyan workers are in the informal sector, lacking health insurance and financial protection.

## üîç Key Findings

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## üìå Main Findings

1. **Informal Sector Dominance**: 75-85% of East African workers are in informal employment

2. **Insurance Gap**: Formal workers have 3x higher health insurance coverage than informal workers

3. **Affordability Crisis**: Only 25% of informal casual workers can afford healthcare when needed

4. **Earnings Disparity**: Formal full-time workers earn 5-8x more than informal casual workers

5. **Slow Formalization**: Kenya's formal employment rate growing by only 0.5% per year

6. **Kenya's Challenge**: 16+ million informal workers lack employer-sponsored health coverage
:::

## üí° Policy Implications

### Expanding Health Coverage to Informal Workers

1. **Health Insurance Reforms**
   - Subsidized premiums for informal workers
   - Mobile money integration for contributions
   - Simplified enrollment processes

2. **Social Protection Extension**
   - Universal health coverage implementation
   - Community-based insurance schemes
   - Cash transfer programs for poorest

3. **Labor Market Interventions**
   - Formalization incentives for employers
   - Skills training for informal workers
   - Job creation in formal sector

4. **Behavioral Economics Insights**
   - Reduce transaction costs for insurance enrollment
   - Default enrollment with opt-out option
   - Peer influence and community mobilization

---

## üî¨ Research Questions for PhD

### Household-Level Analysis

1. **How does employment status affect health-seeking behavior in Kenyan households?**
   - Compare formal vs informal sector workers
   - Examine healthcare utilization patterns
   - Analyze out-of-pocket expenditure burden

2. **What is the causal effect of job loss on health outcomes?**
   - Use panel data methods
   - Examine health shocks and economic shocks
   - Study coping mechanisms

3. **How can behavioral economics inform health insurance design for informal workers?**
   - Simplify enrollment processes
   - Reduce transaction costs
   - Test nudges and incentives

4. **What role do labor market policies play in achieving UHC?**
   - Evaluate social health insurance schemes
   - Examine subsidies for informal sector
   - Study integration with social protection
