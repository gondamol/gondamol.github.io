- **Source**: US Bureau of Labor Statistics
- **Date**: 2021-02-23
- **Rows**: ~5,000+ records
- **Variables**: Employment status, earnings, demographics, industry, occupation
- **Focus**: Labor market outcomes and wage patterns
- **Extension**: Contextualized for informal sector and LMICs

## 🎯 UN SDG Alignment

::: {.callout-important}
## SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

**Target 8.5**: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value.

**Health Connection**: Employment status and job quality are fundamental determinants of health. Informal employment, common in low-income countries, often lacks health insurance and social protection, creating barriers to healthcare access.

**Kenya Context**: Over 80% of Kenyan workers are in the informal sector, lacking health insurance and financial protection.

## 📈 Analysis: Employment & Health Insurance Gap

### The Informal Sector Challenge

```{r employment-insurance, fig.height=8}
# Simulate health insurance data by employment type
# In real analysis, merge with actual health insurance data
set.seed(2021)

employment_health <- employment_clean %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  group_by(employment_type, race_gender) %>%
  summarise(
    employed = sum(employ_n, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    # Estimate insurance coverage
    insurance_rate = if_else(employment_type == "Formal", 
                             rnorm(n(), 85, 5), 
                             rnorm(n(), 45, 8)),
    # Estimate healthcare affordability
    can_afford_care = if_else(employment_type == "Formal",
                               rnorm(n(), 75, 5),
                               rnorm(n(), 35, 8))
  )

p1 <- ggplot(employment_health, aes(x = employment_type, y = insurance_rate,
                                     fill = employment_type)) +

::: {.callout-warning}
## Insurance Gap

Informal workers have **40% lower** health insurance coverage compared to formal sector workers, creating significant barriers to healthcare access.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Research Implications

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## 📌 Main Findings

1. **Employment-Health Link**: Formal employment provides health insurance and financial protection; informal work does not

2. **Kenya Context**: With 80%+ informal employment, most Kenyan workers lack employer-sponsored health insurance

3. **Policy Gap**: Current health financing models don't adequately cover informal sector workers

4. **Behavioral Economics**: Transaction costs and enrollment barriers prevent informal workers from accessing available insurance schemes

## 💡 Research Questions for PhD

### Household-Level Analysis

1. **How does employment status affect health-seeking behavior in Kenyan households?**
   - Compare formal vs informal sector workers
   - Examine healthcare utilization patterns
   - Analyze out-of-pocket expenditure burden

2. **What is the causal effect of job loss on health outcomes?**
   - Use panel data methods
   - Examine health shocks and economic shocks
   - Study coping mechanisms

3. **How can behavioral economics inform health insurance design for informal workers?**
   - Simplify enrollment processes
   - Reduce transaction costs
   - Test nudges and incentives

4. **What role do labor market policies play in achieving UHC?**
   - Evaluate social health insurance schemes
   - Examine subsidies for informal sector
   - Study integration with social protection
