## 🎯 UN SDG Alignment

::: {.callout-important}
## SDG 3.8: Universal Health Coverage

**Target**: Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

**Key Indicators**:
- Health service coverage index
- Proportion of population with large household expenditures on health
- Government health expenditure as % of GDP

This analysis examines health financing patterns in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on the relationship between health expenditure, health outcomes, and progress toward UHC.

```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Insight

Low-income countries spend **less than $100 per capita** on health, compared to **$4,000+** in high-income countries. This 40-fold gap translates to a **20-year difference** in life expectancy.

p3
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Coverage Gap

Only **60%** of low-income countries achieve 90% immunization coverage, compared to **95%** of high-income countries. This reflects broader gaps in essential health service access.

## 🔍 Key Findings

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## 📌 Main Findings

1. **Financing Gap**: Low-income countries spend <$100 per capita on health vs $4,000+ in high-income countries

2. **Health Outcomes**: 20-year life expectancy gap between income groups, strongly correlated with health spending

3. **UHC Progress**: Immunization coverage varies widely in low-income countries (40-95%), indicating uneven access to essential services

4. **East Africa**: Kenya's health spending (~5% of GDP) is moderate for the region, with room for improvement toward UHC

5. **Efficiency Matters**: Some low-income countries achieve better outcomes with similar spending, suggesting importance of health system efficiency

## 💡 Policy Implications

### Pathways to Universal Health Coverage

1. **Increase Domestic Financing**
   - Raise health spending to at least 5% of GDP (Abuja Declaration)
   - Improve tax collection and allocate more to health
   - Reduce out-of-pocket expenditure burden

2. **Improve Efficiency**
   - Learn from countries achieving better outcomes with similar resources
   - Strengthen primary health care systems
   - Reduce wastage and improve procurement

3. **Financial Protection**
   - Expand health insurance coverage
   - Reduce catastrophic health expenditure
   - Protect vulnerable populations

4. **Focus on Equity**
   - Target resources to underserved populations
   - Improve rural and informal sector coverage
   - Address social determinants of health

## 🔬 Research Implications

### Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Household-Level Analysis**: How do health expenditures affect household finances in low-income settings?

2. **Labor Market Linkages**: What is the relationship between employment status, health insurance, and health outcomes?

3. **Behavioral Economics**: How do financial barriers affect health-seeking behavior?

4. **Causal Inference**: What is the causal effect of health financing reforms on health outcomes?

5. **Kenya Context**: How can Kenya accelerate progress toward UHC given fiscal constraints?
