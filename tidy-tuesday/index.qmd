# 📊 TidyTuesday Projects

Welcome to my TidyTuesday collection! Here, I explore datasets focused on **health economics**, **inequalities**, **global health**, **development**, and **climate change** - all aligned with the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

My analyses emphasize **health financing**, **economic inequalities**, **labor markets**, and their impact on health access in **low- and middle-income countries**, particularly in **Sub-Saharan Africa**. Each project demonstrates rigorous data analysis, visualization, and policy-relevant insights.

## 🔬 Research Focus

::: {.callout-tip}
## My Research Interests

My work lies at the intersection of **health economics**, **epidemiology**, and **policy** in low- and middle-income countries. I am particularly interested in:

- **Health Care Financing** & Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
- **Economic Inequalities** and Health Disparities
- **Behavioral Economics** in Health Decision-Making
- **Labor Markets** and Health Outcomes
- **Household-Level Health Economics**

Drawing on my background in **epidemiology and biostatistics** (MSc, University of Nairobi), I aim to conduct **household-level analyses** that examine the complex relationships between **employment status**, **income security**, and **health-seeking behavior**. My goal is to generate **actionable evidence** for policymakers working toward **universal health coverage** and **financial protection** in resource-constrained settings, with a focus on **Kenya** and **East Africa**.

## 📈 What is TidyTuesday?

[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project in R from the R4DS Online Learning Community. Each Tuesday, a new dataset is released for the community to explore, analyze, and visualize.

**My focus**: Using data analysis and visualization to examine **health economics** and **inequalities** in low-income countries, contributing to **evidence-based policy** for achieving **universal health coverage** and the UN SDGs.

**Research Approach**: I apply **econometric methods**, **causal inference thinking**, and **household-level analysis** to understand how **economic factors** shape health access and outcomes in resource-constrained settings.
