## 🎯 UN SDG Alignment

::: {.callout-important}
## SDG 3.8: Universal Health Coverage

**Target**: Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection and access to quality essential health-care services for all.

**Key Indicators**:
- Health service coverage index
- Household expenditures on health
- Government health expenditure as % of GDP

This analysis examines health financing patterns in LMICs, focusing on the relationship between health expenditure, health outcomes, and progress toward UHC.

## 💡 Key Insight

Low-income countries spend **less than $100 per capita** on health, compared to **$4,000+** in high-income countries. This **40-fold gap** translates to a **20-year difference** in life expectancy.

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ Coverage Gap

Only **60-70%** of low-income countries achieve the 90% immunization target, compared to **95%+** of high-income countries. This reflects broader gaps in essential health service access.

## 🔍 Key Findings

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## 📌 Summary

1. **Massive Financing Gap**: A 40-fold difference in health spending between low and high-income countries

2. **Health Outcomes Correlation**: Strong positive relationship between health expenditure and life expectancy

3. **UHC Progress Gaps**: Immunization coverage varies widely in LICs (60-85%), indicating uneven access to essential services

4. **Regional Context**: Kenya's health spending (~$150/capita) is moderate for East Africa, with room for improvement

5. **Efficiency Opportunities**: Some countries achieve better outcomes with similar resources, highlighting importance of health system efficiency
:::

## 💡 Policy Implications

### Pathways to Universal Health Coverage

1. **Increase Domestic Financing**
   - Raise health spending to 5%+ of GDP (Abuja Declaration)
   - Improve tax collection and allocate more to health

2. **Improve Efficiency**
   - Learn from countries achieving better outcomes with similar resources
   - Strengthen primary health care systems

3. **Financial Protection**
   - Expand health insurance coverage
   - Reduce catastrophic health expenditure
   - Protect vulnerable populations

4. **Focus on Equity**
   - Target resources to underserved populations
   - Improve rural and informal sector coverage

## 🔬 Research Questions

### For Further Investigation

1. **Household-Level Analysis**: How do health expenditures affect household finances in low-income settings?

2. **Labor Market Linkages**: What is the relationship between employment status, health insurance, and health outcomes?

3. **Behavioral Economics**: How do financial barriers affect health-seeking behavior?

4. **Causal Inference**: What is the causal effect of health financing reforms on health outcomes?

5. **Kenya Context**: How can Kenya accelerate progress toward UHC given fiscal constraints?

*This analysis demonstrates data visualization and health economics analysis skills. My research interests focus on health financing, inequalities, and behavioral economics in low-income countries, particularly Kenya and East Africa.*
