Currently with Georgetown University gui2de conducting RCTs and impact evaluations, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive program success and policy change.\nWhat makes me different: I‚Äôve led the complete project lifecycle‚Äîfrom designing M&E frameworks and training field teams of 50+ enumerators, to conducting high-frequency checks (HFCs) in R & Stata, to delivering compelling donor reports. With Washington University M&E Certification (2025) and 3 published papers, I bring both academic rigor and practical field experience."
