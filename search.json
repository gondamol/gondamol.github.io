People like Davin Adhiambo, who battled stage one uterine cancer, temporarily losing her sight and mobility, but who fought back to recovery.\nEvery percentage point represented a life that could be saved with better tracking, timely interventions, and data-driven care."

But I’ve overcome my fears and gained courage through this experience.”\nToday, her cancer has been reduced to 1%. She’s studying at Migosi Institute of Science and Technology, dreaming of becoming a social worker.\nThis is what data-driven care can achieve.\n\nStories like Davin’s fuel my passion for health data science.

Seems small, but it’s costing us $50,000 per month.\n[Show data: Revenue impact calculation]\nWhen I dug into the data, I found the problem: mobile conversion crashed after our site redesign. Desktop users convert at 4.8%, but mobile users - who are 60% of our traffic - convert at only 2.1%.\n[Show comparison: Mobile vs Desktop funnel]\nThe solution: Our new checkout has a bug on mobile that’s causing errors. Fixing this could recover $45K monthly.\nNext steps: 1. Fix the mobile bug (2 days) 2. Run A/B test (1 week) 3. Monitor recovery\nI recommend we prioritize this over all other projects this sprint.”"

    "section": "The 15 Statistical Concepts That Matter",
    "text": "The 15 Statistical Concepts That Matter\n\nTier 1: Descriptive Statistics (Use Daily)\n\n1. Mean, Median, Mode (Central Tendency)\nWhat They Are: - Mean: Average (add all, divide by count) - Median: Middle value when sorted - Mode: Most frequent value\nWhen to Use Which:\n\n\n\nData Type\nBest Measure\nWhy\n\n\n\n\nSalaries\nMedian\nOutliers (CEOs) skew mean\n\n\nTest scores\nMean\nNormal distribution\n\n\nShoe sizes\nMode\nDiscrete choices\n\n\nHouse prices\nMedian\nHigh-value outliers\n\n\n\nReal Example:\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nsalaries = [50000, 52000, 55000, 58000, 500000]  # CEO ruins the mean\n\nmean_salary = np.mean(salaries)    # $143,000 (misleading!)\nmedian_salary = np.median(salaries) # $55,000 (realistic)\nKey Insight: If mean &gt;&gt; median, you have outliers or right-skewed data.\n\n\n\n2. Standard Deviation & Variance (Spread)\nWhat They Measure: How spread out your data is\nFormula (Don’t Memorize, Understand): - Variance: Average squared distance from mean - Standard Deviation: Square root of variance\nPractical Interpretation: - Low StdDev: Data clustered (consistent) - High StdDev: Data spread out (variable)\nReal Example:\n# Two sales teams with same average\nteam_a_sales = [100, 105, 98, 102, 95]  # Consistent\nteam_b_sales = [50, 150, 80, 120, 100]  # Variable\n\nprint(f\"Team A StdDev: {np.std(team_a_sales):.2f}\")  # 3.56\nprint(f\"Team B StdDev: {np.std(team_b_sales):.2f}\")  # 32.25\n\n# Team A is more predictable!\nFREE Resources: - Khan Academy: Standard Deviation - StatQuest: SD Explained\n\n\n\n3. Percentiles & Quartiles (Distribution Position)\nWhat They Are: - Percentile: % of data below a value - Quartiles: 25th, 50th (median), 75th percentiles - IQR: Interquartile Range (Q3 - Q1)\nWhy They Matter: - Identify outliers (&gt; Q3 + 1.5×IQR or &lt; Q1 - 1.5×IQR) - Understand distribution - Set thresholds\nReal Example:\nsales = df['order_amount']\n\nq1 = sales.quantile(0.25)    # 25th percentile\nq2 = sales.quantile(0.50)    # Median\nq3 = sales.quantile(0.75)    # 75th percentile\niqr = q3 - q1\n\n# Flag potential outliers\noutliers = sales[(sales &gt; q3 + 1.5*iqr) | (sales &lt; q1 - 1.5*iqr)]\nUse Case: “Our top 10% customers (90th percentile) spend over $500”\n\n\n\n\nTier 2: Probability & Distributions (Use Weekly)\n\n4. Normal Distribution (The Bell Curve)\nKey Properties: - Mean = Median = Mode - 68% within 1 StdDev - 95% within 2 StdDevs - 99.7% within 3 StdDevs\nWhen Data is Normal: - Heights, weights - Test scores - Measurement errors - Many natural phenomena\nWhy It Matters: Many statistical tests assume normality.\nCheck for Normality:\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Visual check\nplt.hist(data, bins=30)\nplt.show()\n\n# Statistical test\nstatistic, p_value = stats.shapiro(data)\nif p_value &gt; 0.05:\n    print(\"Data appears normal\")\nFREE Resources: - Khan Academy: Normal Distribution - StatQuest: Normal Distribution\n\n\n\n5. Correlation (Relationships Between Variables)\nWhat It Measures: Strength and direction of linear relationship (-1 to +1)\nCorrelation Coefficients: - +1: Perfect positive (both increase together) - 0: No linear relationship - -1: Perfect negative (one increases, other decreases)\nCRITICAL: Correlation ≠ Causation\nReal Examples:\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Calculate correlation matrix\ncorr_matrix = df[['age', 'income', 'spending']].corr()\n\n# Visualize\nsns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\nCommon Correlations: - Ice cream sales vs. drownings: High correlation (both caused by summer) - Education vs. income: Positive correlation (potentially causal) - Exercise vs. weight: Negative correlation (likely causal)\nFREE Resources: - Khan Academy: Correlation - Spurious Correlations - Fun examples\n\n\n\n6. Statistical Significance & P-Values\nWhat They Mean: - P-value: Probability of observing results if null hypothesis is true - p &lt; 0.05: Commonly used threshold for “significant”\nTranslation: - p = 0.03: 3% chance result is due to random chance (likely real effect) - p = 0.47: 47% chance result is random (probably no real effect)\nIMPORTANT: - p &lt; 0.05 doesn’t mean “important” or “large effect” - With huge samples, tiny effects become “significant” - Always report effect size too\nReal Example:\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# A/B test: control vs variant\ncontrol_conversions = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, ...]    # 10,000 users\nvariant_conversions = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, ...]    # 10,000 users\n\n# Chi-square test\nchi2, p_value = stats.chi2_contingency([[control_sum, variant_sum], \n                                        [control_total, variant_total]])\n\nif p_value &lt; 0.05:\n    print(f\"Variant is significantly different (p={p_value:.3f})\")\nFREE Resources: - StatQuest: P-Values - Seeing Theory: Frequentist Inference\n\n\n\n\nTier 3: Hypothesis Testing (Use Monthly)\n\n7. T-Tests (Comparing Two Groups)\nWhen to Use: - Compare means of two groups - Example: “Is average order value different between mobile vs desktop?”\nTypes: - One-sample: Compare group mean to a known value - Independent samples: Compare two different groups - Paired samples: Before-after comparisons\nReal Example:\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# Compare average order value: mobile vs desktop\nmobile_orders = df[df['device'] == 'mobile']['order_value']\ndesktop_orders = df[df['device'] == 'desktop']['order_value']\n\n# Perform t-test\nt_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(mobile_orders, desktop_orders)\n\nprint(f\"t-statistic: {t_stat:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value: {p_value:.3f}\")\n\nif p_value &lt; 0.05:\n    print(\"Significant difference between mobile and desktop orders\")\n\n\n\n8. Chi-Square Test (Categorical Relationships)\nWhen to Use: - Test relationship between two categorical variables - Example: “Is there a relationship between gender and product preference?”\nReal Example:\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Contingency table\ndata = pd.crosstab(df['gender'], df['product_category'])\n\n# Chi-square test\nchi2, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(data)\n\nif p_value &lt; 0.05:\n    print(\"Gender and product preference are related\")\n\n\n\n9. ANOVA (Comparing 3+ Groups)\nWhen to Use: - Compare means across multiple groups - Example: “Is customer satisfaction different across regions (North, South, East, West)?”\nReal Example:\nfrom scipy import stats\n\nnorth = df[df['region'] == 'North']['satisfaction']\nsouth = df[df['region'] == 'South']['satisfaction']\neast = df[df['region'] == 'East']['satisfaction']\nwest = df[df['region'] == 'West']['satisfaction']\n\n# One-way ANOVA\nf_stat, p_value = stats.f_oneway(north, south, east, west)\n\nif p_value &lt; 0.05:\n    print(\"Satisfaction differs significantly across regions\")\n    # Follow up with post-hoc tests to see which pairs differ\n\n\n\n\nTier 4: Regression & Forecasting (Advanced)\n\n10. Linear Regression (Predict Numeric Outcomes)\nWhat It Does: - Predicts continuous variable from one or more predictors - Finds “line of best fit”\nEquation: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + … + ε\nReal Example:\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Predict sales from advertising spend\nX = df[['tv_ads', 'radio_ads', 'digital_ads']]\ny = df['sales']\n\n# Split data\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n\n# Train model\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Interpret coefficients\nfor feature, coef in zip(X.columns, model.coef_):\n    print(f\"{feature}: ${coef:.2f} sales per $1 spent\")\n\n# Make predictions\npredictions = model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\nprint(f\"R² Score: {r2_score(y_test, predictions):.3f}\")\nKey Metrics: - R²: % of variance explained (0 to 1, higher is better) - Coefficients: Effect of each predictor - Residuals: Difference between actual and predicted\n\n\n\n11. Logistic Regression (Predict Binary Outcomes)\nWhen to Use: - Predict yes/no, true/false, 0/1 - Examples: Will customer churn? Will lead convert?\nReal Example:\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix\n\n# Predict customer churn\nX = df[['tenure', 'monthly_charges', 'total_charges']]\ny = df['churn']  # 0 or 1\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n\nmodel = LogisticRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\npredictions = model.predict(X_test)\n\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions):.3f}\")\nprint(\"Confusion Matrix:\")\nprint(confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions))\n\n\n\n\nTier 5: Confidence & Sampling\n\n12. Confidence Intervals (Estimate Ranges)\nWhat They Are: Range where true population parameter likely falls (usually 95%)\nTranslation: “We’re 95% confident the true average order value is between $45-$55”\nReal Example:\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# Calculate 95% confidence interval for mean\ndata = df['order_value']\nconfidence = 0.95\n\nmean = np.mean(data)\nstderr = stats.sem(data)\ninterval = stderr * stats.t.ppf((1 + confidence) / 2, len(data) - 1)\n\nprint(f\"Mean: ${mean:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"95% CI: ${mean - interval:.2f} to ${mean + interval:.2f}\")\n\n\n\n13. Sample Size (How Much Data Do You Need?)\nRules of Thumb: - Surveys: 385+ for 95% confidence, 5% margin of error - A/B tests: Depends on expected effect size (use calculators) - Machine learning: 10x rows per feature minimum\nSample Size Calculators (FREE): - Evan Miller A/B Test Calculator - SurveyMonkey Sample Size Calculator\n\n\n\n14. Sampling Methods\nTypes: - Simple Random: Everyone has equal chance - Stratified: Sample proportionally from subgroups - Cluster: Sample entire groups - Convenience: Whoever is available (⚠️ biased)\nWhen Each Matters: - Random: Most surveys - Stratified: Ensure representation (e.g., demographics) - Cluster: Geographic studies - Convenience: Avoid for serious analysis\n\n\n\n15. Type I & Type II Errors\nDefinitions: - Type I Error (False Positive): Finding effect that doesn’t exist (α = 0.05) - Type II Error (False Negative): Missing real effect (β, power = 1 - β)\nReal-World Examples: - Type I: Saying new feature increased signups when it didn’t - Type II: Missing that new feature DID increase signups\nControlling Errors: - Reduce Type I: Lower α (p &lt; 0.01 instead of 0.05) - Reduce Type II: Increase sample size, increase power"

    "text": "The 20% of Excel That Delivers 80% of Results\n\nTier 1: These Will Save You Hours Daily\n\n1. Keyboard Shortcuts (Learn These TODAY)\nNavigation: - Ctrl + Arrow Keys - Jump to data edges - Ctrl + Home - Go to A1 - Ctrl + End - Go to last used cell - Alt + Page Down/Up - Move screen right/left\nSelection: - Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Keys - Select to data edge - Ctrl + Space - Select entire column - Shift + Space - Select entire row - Ctrl + A - Select all\nEditing: - Ctrl + D - Fill down - Ctrl + R - Fill right - F2 - Edit cell - Ctrl + ; - Insert current date - Ctrl + Shift + ; - Insert current time\nFormatting: - Ctrl + 1 - Format cells dialog - Ctrl + B/I/U - Bold/Italic/Underline - Ctrl + Shift + $ - Currency format\nFREE Cheat Sheet: - Excel Shortcuts PDF\n\n\n\n2. Tables (Stop Using Ranges!)\nWhy Tables Change Everything: - Auto-expanding formulas - Built-in filtering and sorting - Structured references (no more cell references!) - Professional appearance\nHow to Convert: 1. Select your data 2. Press Ctrl + T 3. Name your table (Table Tools → Design → Table Name)\nExample:\nInstead of: =SUM(A2:A100)\nUse: =SUM(Sales[Amount])\nBenefits: - Formulas update automatically when you add data - Clear, readable formulas - No broken references\nFREE Resources: - Microsoft: Excel Tables - Excel Tables Tutorial\n\n\n\n3. Pivot Tables (Your Secret Weapon)\nWhat They Do: - Summarize millions of rows instantly - Dynamic analysis without formulas - Professional-looking summaries\nHow to Create: 1. Select your data table 2. Insert → PivotTable 3. Drag fields to Rows, Columns, and Values\nCommon Use Cases: - Sales by region and product - Employee headcount by department - Revenue trends over time - Customer segmentation\nPractice Dataset: - Sample Sales Data (Excel)\nFREE Training: - Microsoft: PivotTable Tutorial - MyOnlineTrainingHub YouTube - Excel Campus PivotTables\n\n\n\n\nTier 2: Functions That Separate Pros from Amateurs\n\nVLOOKUP/XLOOKUP (Merge Data Like a Database)\nOld Way (VLOOKUP):\n=VLOOKUP(A2, ProductTable, 3, FALSE)\nNew Way (XLOOKUP - Excel 365):\n=XLOOKUP(A2, Products[ID], Products[Name])\nWhy It Matters: - Combine data from different sheets - Look up product names, prices, categories - Essential for data cleaning\nPractice Problems: - VLOOKUP Exercises\n\n\n\nIF + AND/OR (Business Logic)\nSimple IF:\n=IF(A2 &gt; 100, \"High\", \"Low\")\nComplex Nested:\n=IF(A2 &gt; 100, \"High\", IF(A2 &gt; 50, \"Medium\", \"Low\"))\nWith AND/OR:\n=IF(AND(A2 &gt; 100, B2 = \"Active\"), \"Priority\", \"Normal\")\n=IF(OR(A2 &gt; 1000, B2 = \"VIP\"), \"Special\", \"Regular\")\nReal Example (Sales Commission):\n=IF(Sales &gt; 100000, Sales * 0.15, IF(Sales &gt; 50000, Sales * 0.10, Sales * 0.05))\n\n\n\nSUMIF/SUMIFS, COUNTIF/COUNTIFS (Conditional Aggregation)\nSingle Condition:\n=SUMIF(Region, \"West\", Sales)\n=COUNTIF(Status, \"Active\")\nMultiple Conditions:\n=SUMIFS(Sales, Region, \"West\", Product, \"Widget\", Year, 2024)\n=COUNTIFS(Age, \"&gt;30\", Department, \"Sales\")\nWhy Critical: - Calculate metrics by category - Filter data without pivot tables - Dynamic reporting\n\n\n\nTEXT Functions (Clean Messy Data)\nEssential Functions:\nLEFT/RIGHT/MID (Extract text)\n=LEFT(A2, 3)  // First 3 characters\n=RIGHT(A2, 2)  // Last 2 characters\n=MID(A2, 3, 5)  // 5 characters starting at position 3\nCONCATENATE/CONCAT (Combine text)\n=CONCAT(First Name, \" \", Last Name)\n=A2 & \" \" & B2  // Alternative\nTRIM (Remove extra spaces)\n=TRIM(A2)  // Removes leading, trailing, and extra middle spaces\nUPPER/LOWER/PROPER (Fix capitalization)\n=UPPER(A2)  // ALL CAPS\n=LOWER(A2)  // all lowercase\n=PROPER(A2)  // Title Case\nTEXT (Format numbers)\n=TEXT(A2, \"mm/dd/yyyy\")  // Date formatting\n=TEXT(A2, \"$#,##0.00\")  // Currency formatting\n\n\n\nDate Functions (Time-Based Analysis)\nCore Functions:\n=TODAY()  // Current date\n=NOW()  // Current date and time\n=YEAR(A2)  // Extract year\n=MONTH(A2)  // Extract month\n=DAY(A2)  // Extract day\n=WEEKDAY(A2)  // Day of week (1-7)\n=EOMONTH(A2, 0)  // End of month\n=DATEDIF(Start, End, \"D\")  // Days between dates\nBusiness Examples:\n// Age calculation\n=DATEDIF(BirthDate, TODAY(), \"Y\")\n\n// Days until deadline\n=Deadline - TODAY()\n\n// Quarter\n=\"Q\" & ROUNDUP(MONTH(A2)/3, 0)\n\n// Week number\n=WEEKNUM(A2)\n\n\n\n\nTier 3: Advanced (But Learnable) Techniques\n\nPower Query (Data Transformation)\nWhat It Does: - Import data from multiple sources - Clean and transform data - Automate repetitive data prep - Merge datasets like SQL JOIN\nHow to Access: - Data → Get & Transform Data → Get Data\nUse Cases: - Combine 100 Excel files into one - Clean messy text data - Unpivot data - Merge sales data with customer data\nFREE Learning: - Microsoft: Power Query Overview - Excel Off The Grid YouTube - How to Excel at Excel YouTube\n\n\n\nDynamic Arrays (Excel 365 Game-Changer)\nNew Functions:\nFILTER:\n=FILTER(Sales, Region = \"West\")  // Returns all West region sales\nSORT/SORTBY:\n=SORT(Sales, 2, -1)  // Sort by 2nd column, descending\nUNIQUE:\n=UNIQUE(Customers)  // List of unique customers\nSEQUENCE:\n=SEQUENCE(10)  // Numbers 1 to 10\nWhy Revolutionary: - One formula, multiple results - No more Ctrl+Shift+Enter - Dynamic, auto-updating lists\n\n\n\nConditional Formatting (Visual Analysis)\nBest Practices:\n1. Data Bars (Show magnitude) - Home → Conditional Formatting → Data Bars - Great for sales, percentages, progress\n2. Color Scales (Heat maps) - Home → Conditional Formatting → Color Scales - Identify patterns quickly\n3. Icon Sets (Status indicators) - Arrows, traffic lights, flags - Perfect for KPIs, status tracking\n4. Custom Rules (Highlight specific conditions)\n=AND($B2 &gt; 100, $C2 = \"Active\")  // Highlight rows meeting both conditions"

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Non communicable diseases, especially hypertension and diabetes, account for a substantial share of mortality in Kenya. Despite health service devolution to county governments since 2013, financing for chronic care at the primary health care level remains weak. This study examined financial determinants shaping hypertension and diabetes care in rural Kisumu County.\nMethods: The study used a convergent parallel mixed methods cross sectional design in seven public primary health care facilities in Seme Sub County. Quantitative data came from structured questionnaires and retrospective financial record review for January to August 2024. Qualitative data came from in depth interviews with facility in charges. Quantitative analysis used descriptive statistics in STATA v16 and qualitative analysis used thematic coding in R.\nResults: All seven facilities prepared annual workplans and budgets, but none achieved comprehensive NCD specific planning with a dedicated NCD budget line. Most facilities depended on NHIF reimbursements and donor support, while few received direct county funding. All facilities had bank accounts, but none had full spending autonomy. County level expenditure approval often took weeks to months, limiting timely local procurement during stockouts. Frequent medicine stockouts were reported by 85.7 percent of facilities.\nConclusion: Facility level financing constraints are strongly linked to weaker chronic disease service continuity in rural primary care. Strengthening facility spending autonomy, ring fencing NCD budgets, diversifying financing, and speeding disbursement and emergency procurement are critical for effective and equitable chronic care delivery under UHC."

It shows up in how I train enumerators: I want them to understand why the question is structured the way it is, not just how to tap the screen. And it shows up in how I write reports: I want to change a decision, not demonstrate that I can run a regression."

    "section": "Analysis & Insights",
    "text": "Analysis & Insights\n\nKey Findings\n\nPersistent Regional Disparities: The analysis reveals significant regional disparities in food security. High-income countries (USA, Germany, France, UK, Japan) consistently score above 80 on the food security index, while countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia) and conflict-affected regions (Yemen, Afghanistan, Sudan) score below 50. This 30-40 point gap represents a critical development challenge.\nStrong Relationship Between Food Availability and Security: There is a clear positive correlation between calories per capita and food security index. However, the relationship is not perfect—some countries with adequate calorie availability still have low food security scores due to factors like food price volatility, poverty, and inequality in food access.\nUndernourishment Declines with Food Security: The analysis shows a strong inverse relationship (correlation ~ -0.95) between food security index and undernourishment rates. Countries with food security indices above 70 typically have undernourishment rates below 5%, while countries below 40 have rates above 50%. This confirms that the food security index is a valid measure of actual hunger.\nPoverty is a Key Driver: Poverty rates show a strong negative correlation with food security. Countries with high poverty rates (above 40%) almost universally have low food security (below 50), highlighting that food insecurity is fundamentally an issue of economic access, not just food availability.\nLimited Progress Over Time: While most countries show slight improvements in food security from 2015-2022, the gains are modest (typically 1-3 points). Countries with very low food security (below 30) show minimal improvement, suggesting that incremental approaches may be insufficient for the most vulnerable populations.\n\n\n\nRegional Patterns\n\nSub-Saharan Africa: The region shows the lowest average food security (40-50), with multiple countries facing crisis levels. Factors include: high poverty, climate variability, conflict, and limited agricultural productivity.\nSouth Asia: Moderate food security (55-65), but high absolute numbers of undernourished people due to large populations. Countries like India and Bangladesh have made progress but face challenges of inequality and access.\nHigh-Income Countries: Consistently high food security (80-90), though some face challenges of food waste, nutritional quality, and inequality in access to healthy foods."

Multi-Dimensional Approach Required\n\nFood security has four dimensions: availability, access, utilization, and stability\nPolicies must address all dimensions, not just production\nSocial protection programs (cash transfers, food assistance) are critical for access\n\n\n\n2. Focus on Smallholder Agriculture\n\nMost food-insecure populations are in rural areas dependent on agriculture\nSupport for smallholder farmers (inputs, credit, markets) can improve both availability and access\nClimate-smart agriculture is essential for stability\n\n\n\n3. Address Poverty and Inequality\n\nFood insecurity is fundamentally about economic access\nPoverty reduction programs directly improve food security\nPolicies to reduce income inequality can improve food access for the poorest\n\n\n\n4. Build Resilience to Shocks\n\nFood price volatility and climate shocks can quickly undermine food security\nSocial safety nets, food reserves, and early warning systems are essential\nDiversification of food sources and income can reduce vulnerability\n\n\n\n5. Conflict and Governance\n\nCountries affected by conflict show the worst food security outcomes\nPeace and stability are prerequisites for food security\nGood governance, including transparent food markets and policies, matters"

    "text": "Conclusion\nAchieving SDG 2: Zero Hunger by 2030 remains a significant challenge. While progress has been made in reducing global undernourishment rates, significant disparities persist, and many countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and conflict-affected regions, face crisis-level food insecurity.\nThe analysis presented here demonstrates that: - Food security is multi-dimensional: It’s not just about production, but access, utilization, and stability - Poverty is the root cause: Economic access is fundamental to food security - Regional disparities are stark: Some regions require urgent and accelerated action - Progress is possible but slow: Incremental improvements are insufficient for crisis-level situations\nAchieving zero hunger requires: - Integrated policies addressing all dimensions of food security - Focus on the most vulnerable populations and regions - Long-term investments in agriculture, infrastructure, and social protection - Peace, stability, and good governance - Climate action to ensure food system resilience\nThe visualization and analysis presented here underscore both the progress made and the urgent work that remains in the global effort to eliminate hunger."

Weekend sales are 40% lower than weekdays\n3. Mobile traffic has poor conversion (18% vs 42% desktop)\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Increase marketing spend on top 3 products\n2. Weekend promotion campaigns needed\n3. Optimize mobile checkout process\nExample Datasets: - Superstore Dataset - Kaggle E-Commerce Data - Adventure Works\nTemplate README:\n# E-Commerce Sales Dashboard\n\n## Problem Statement\n[Company] needed a real-time dashboard to monitor...\n\n## Data Source  \n- Kaggle E-Commerce Dataset (500K orders, 2019-2023)\n- Cleaned in Python (removed 5% null values)\n\n## Tools Used\n- Python (pandas, numpy) for data cleaning\n- Tableau Public for visualization\n- SQL for initial exploration\n\n## Key Insights\n1. [Insight with business impact]\n2. [Insight with business impact]\n3. [Insight with business impact]\n\n## Interactive Dashboard\n[Link to Tableau Public/Power BI]\n\n## Screenshots\n[Include 3-5 screenshots with captions]\n\n## Skills Demonstrated\n- Data cleaning & transformation\n- KPI selection\n- Dashboard design\n- Business storytelling\n\n\n\nProject 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nWhy It Matters: - Shows statistical thinking - Proves you can find patterns - Demonstrates hypothesis testing\nStructure:\nResearch Question: What factors influence employee attrition?\n\nDataset: IBM HR Analytics Dataset\n\nMethodology:\n1. Data Cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)\n2. Univariate Analysis (distributions)\n3. Bivariate Analysis (correlations)\n4. Multivariate Analysis (complex relationships)\n5. Statistical Testing (t-tests, chi-square)\n\nKey Findings:\n1. Employees with &lt;2 years tenure have 47% attrition rate\n2. Overtime workers are 3.2x more likely to leave\n3. Job satisfaction score &lt;2 predicts 68% of attrition\n\nStatistical Evidence:\n- Chi-square test: p &lt; 0.001 (overtime vs attrition)\n- T-test: Significant difference in satisfaction scores (p=0.003)\nExample Datasets: - IBM HR Analytics - Titanic Dataset - World Happiness Report\nCode Structure:\n# 1. Imports and Setup\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# 2. Data Loading\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# 3. Data Cleaning\n# Document every decision\n\n# 4. EDA\n# Visualizations with interpretations\n\n# 5. Statistical Tests\n# With clear conclusions\n\n# 6. Summary\n# Key takeaways and limitations\n\n\n\nProject 3: Predictive Model\nWhy It Matters: - Growing requirement (even for analysts) - Shows you understand ML concepts - Demonstrates end-to-end skills\nProject Structure:\nProblem: Predict customer churn for subscription service\n\nDataset: Telco Customer Churn\n\nApproach:\n1. EDA and Feature Engineering\n2. Train-Test Split\n3. Model Selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)\n4. Model Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)\n5. Feature Importance Analysis\n6. Business Recommendations\n\nResults:\n- Best Model: XGBoost (AUC = 0.89)\n- Top 3 Predictors: Contract type, tenure, monthly charges\n- Model identified 85% of churners correctly\n\nBusiness Impact:\n- Targeting high-risk customers could save $1.2M annually\n- Focus retention efforts on month-to-month contract holders\nExample Datasets: - Telco Customer Churn - Credit Card Default - House Prices\nCode Structure:\n# 1. Problem Definition\n# 2. Data Loading and Exploration\n# 3. Data Preprocessing\n#    - Handle missing values\n#    - Encode categorical variables\n#    - Scale numerical features\n# 4. Feature Engineering\n# 5. Model Training\n#    - Multiple algorithms\n#    - Cross-validation\n# 6. Model Evaluation\n#    - Confusion matrix\n#    - ROC curve\n#    - Feature importance\n# 7. Insights and Recommendations\n\n\n\nProject 4: SQL Analysis Project\nWhy It Matters: - SQL is non-negotiable (78% of jobs) - Shows database thinking - Demonstrates query optimization\nProject Example:\nBusiness Problem: Analyze customer purchase patterns to optimize inventory\n\nDataset: E-Commerce Database (4 tables)\n- Customers (100K rows)\n- Orders (500K rows)\n- Order_Items (1.5M rows)\n- Products (5K rows)\n\nSQL Skills Demonstrated:\n1. Complex JOINs (3+ tables)\n2. Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)\n3. CTEs (Common Table Expressions)\n4. Subqueries\n5. Aggregations with GROUP BY\n6. Date Functions\n\nSample Queries:\n\n-- Find top 10 customers by lifetime value\nWITH customer_totals AS (\n    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) as ltv\n    FROM orders\n    GROUP BY customer_id\n)\nSELECT c.customer_name, ct.ltv\nFROM customers c\nJOIN customer_totals ct ON c.customer_id = ct.customer_id\nORDER BY ct.ltv DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n\n-- Calculate 30-day retention rate\nWITH first_purchase AS (\n    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) as first_date\n    FROM orders\n    GROUP BY customer_id\n),\nrepeat_purchase AS (\n    SELECT f.customer_id\n    FROM first_purchase f\n    JOIN orders o ON f.customer_id = o.customer_id\n    WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN f.first_date AND f.first_date + INTERVAL '30 days'\n    AND o.order_date &gt; f.first_date\n)\nSELECT \n    COUNT(DISTINCT r.customer_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT f.customer_id) as retention_rate\nFROM first_purchase f\nLEFT JOIN repeat_purchase r ON f.customer_id = r.customer_id;\n\nInsights:\n1. 30-day retention rate: 32%\n2. Top 10% customers generate 65% of revenue\n3. Average time between purchases: 23 days\nHow to Present: - Create GitHub repo with .sql files - Include schema diagram - Write detailed README with business context - Show query results as tables or visualizations\n\n\n\nProject 5: Unique/Passion Project\nWhy It Matters: - Shows personality and creativity - Demonstrates self-driven learning - Memorable (makes you stand out)\nExamples That Worked: 1. Sports Analytics: “Which NBA position has evolved most since 1990?” (Python + viz) 2. Social Media Analysis: “Analyzing 10K Reddit posts about data careers” (NLP + Python) 3. Personal Finance: “I tracked every dollar I spent for 2 years” (Dashboard + insights) 4. Gaming: “Optimizing Pokémon team selection with data” (Python + ML) 5. Music: “What makes a Spotify hit in 2024?” (Python + Spotify API)\nKeys to Success: - Choose something YOU care about - Make it data-driven (not just opinions) - Show complete workflow (data → insights → viz) - Make it interactive if possible"

Demonstrate passion (why this project specifically?)\nPractice Script:\n\"For this project, I analyzed e-commerce data to help a company understand their customer churn.\n\nThe dataset had 100K customers over 3 years. I started by cleaning the data - there were 5% missing values which I handled by [method].\n\nI then explored the data and found that customers who didn't make a purchase in 90 days had a 70% chance of never returning. This was the key insight.\n\nI built a simple predictive model using Python and scikit-learn, achieving 85% accuracy in predicting churn.\n\nThe business recommendation was to implement a 60-day re-engagement campaign, which could potentially save $500K in lost revenue annually.\n\nThe hardest part was feature engineering - I had to create recency, frequency, and monetary value features which required careful date calculations.\n\nYou can see the full analysis on my GitHub, and I'd be happy to walk through any part in more detail.\""

    "text": "Statistics Interview Questions\n\nQ6: Explain p-value in simple terms\nAnswer: “A p-value is the probability of observing results at least as extreme as what we got, if there really is no effect.\nExample: We test a new ad campaign. P-value = 0.03 means there’s only a 3% chance these results happened by random luck if the campaign doesn’t actually work.\nSince 3% is less than our threshold (usually 5%), we conclude the campaign likely does work.”\n\n\n\nQ7: When would you use median instead of mean?\nAnswer: “Use median when data is skewed or has outliers, because median isn’t affected by extreme values.\nExample: House prices in a neighborhood: - $200K, $210K, $205K, $215K, $5M (celebrity’s house) - Mean: $967K (misleading!) - Median: $210K (representative)\nUse cases: Salaries, house prices, customer spending”\n\n\n\nQ8: What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?\nAnswer: - Type I (False Positive): Saying there’s an effect when there isn’t - Type II (False Negative): Missing a real effect\nMedical Test Analogy: - Type I: Test says you’re sick, but you’re healthy - Type II: Test says you’re healthy, but you’re sick\nBusiness Example: - Type I: Launching a useless feature thinking it’s good - Type II: Rejecting a good feature thinking it’s useless”"

When my manager questioned the numbers, I realized my mistake. I immediately: 1. Acknowledged the error 2. Redid the analysis correctly 3. Documented the issue to prevent future mistakes 4. Created a checklist for similar analyses”\nResult: “The correct analysis showed retention was actually 5% lower than reported, which led to earlier intervention and prevented further losses. I learned to always have someone peer-review my work and to create validation checks.”\n\n\n\nQ13: Describe a time you had to explain technical results to non-technical stakeholders\nAnswer: “I once needed to present a machine learning model’s churn prediction to the CEO.\nChallenge: CEO wanted to know ‘how it works’ but had no ML background.\nApproach: 1. Used analogy: ‘Like how Netflix recommends shows based on similar users, our model predicts churn based on patterns from past churners’ 2. Showed business impact first: ‘85% accuracy means we can save $500K annually’ 3. Used visualizations instead of math 4. Prepared for ‘what if’ questions with interactive dashboard\nResult: Got approval to implement, and CEO became advocate for data-driven decisions.”"

Reproducible research: - Builds public confidence in health recommendations - Reduces the spread of misinformation - Strengthens evidence-based policymaking\nExample: During the COVID-19 pandemic, reproducible research allowed rapid verification of treatment efficacy across different countries and populations.\n\n\n2. Better Decision Making 📊\nHealth administrators and policymakers rely on research to: - Allocate limited resources - Design intervention programs - Set public health priorities\nWithout reproducibility: Poor decisions, wasted resources, and potentially harmful policies.\n\n\n3. Accelerating Scientific Progress 🚀\nReproducible research allows scientists to: - Build on previous work confidently - Identify and correct errors quickly - Collaborate more effectively across institutions\n\n\n4. Cost Efficiency 💰\n\nPrevents duplication of effort\nReduces waste from following up on false findings\nMaximizes research funding impact"

    "text": "Best Practices for Reproducible Research\n\n1. Use Version Control (Git/GitHub) 📁\n# Initialize a Git repository for your project\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit of analysis scripts\"\nBenefits: - Track every change to your code - Collaborate seamlessly with team members - Revert to previous versions if needed\n\n\n2. Document Everything 📝\nCreate a README.md file that includes: - Project overview and objectives - Data sources and collection methods - Software dependencies and versions - Step-by-step analysis workflow - How to reproduce the results\n\n\n3. Use Open Source Tools 🛠️\nRecommended Tools: - R/RStudio - Statistical analysis and reporting - Python - Data processing and machine learning - Jupyter Notebooks - Interactive analysis documentation - Quarto - Scientific publishing system - Docker - Containerize your computing environment\n\n\n4. Share Your Data 📂\nPublic Repositories: - Zenodo - General purpose repository - Dryad - Scientific data repository - Figshare - Research outputs - OSF - Open Science Framework\nRemember: Always anonymize sensitive health data!\n\n\n5. Use Literate Programming 📖\nCombine code, results, and narrative in one document:\nR Markdown Example:\n```{r}\n# Calculate disease prevalence\nprevalence &lt;- sum(cases) / population * 100\n```\n\nThe prevalence of disease X was `r round(prevalence, 2)`%.\n\n\n6. Specify Your Computing Environment 💻\nFor R Projects:\n# Use renv for dependency management\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\nrenv::init()\nrenv::snapshot()\nFor Python Projects:\n# Create requirements file\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\n\n# Or use conda\nconda env export &gt; environment.yml\n\n\n7. Adopt a Standard Project Structure 🗂️\nproject/\n├── data/\n│   ├── raw/\n│   └── processed/\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── 01-data-cleaning.R\n│   ├── 02-analysis.R\n│   └── 03-visualization.R\n├── outputs/\n│   ├── figures/\n│   └── tables/\n├── docs/\n├── README.md\n└── LICENSE\n\n\n8. Use Automated Workflows ⚙️\nMake files or workflow management:\n# Makefile for automated analysis\nall: report.html\n\ndata/clean_data.csv: scripts/01-clean.R data/raw_data.csv\n    Rscript scripts/01-clean.R\n\nreport.html: report.Rmd data/clean_data.csv\n    R -e \"rmarkdown::render('report.Rmd')\""
