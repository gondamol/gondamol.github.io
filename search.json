With a strong background in data management, analysis, and storytelling, I am dedicated to using data to uncover insights that drive impactful decisions.. Over the past few years, I’ve become very interested in research software, open source, reproducibility and data science practices in public sector.\nIn my current role, I leverage my skills to contribute to cutting-edge research and projects that address critical public health challenges. My passion for data extends beyond the workplace, as I continually seek to expand my knowledge and share it through publications, speaking engagements, and mentoring.\nMy Key Research Interests are:\nI am currently pusruing my MSc in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at JOOUST, where I have finshed my coursework and designed a case study design to assess primary health facility financing for management of hypertension and diabestes in kisumu county. I look forward to registering for a PhD position to continue exploring the application of statistical methods in public health data, particularly in randomized clinical trails. Soon, I want to start developing R packages, I want to turn my thesis into a package, transparency, openness, and reproducibility."
