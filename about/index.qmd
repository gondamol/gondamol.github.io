## **Who I Am**

I am a **Senior Research Data Manager** with over **7 years of specialized experience** in health data analytics, survey design, and comprehensive data management. My career has been dedicated to transforming complex health data into actionable insights that drive evidence-based decision-making in resource-limited settings.

My expertise spans the complete data lifecycle‚Äîfrom designing robust data collection systems using **SurveyCTO, REDCap, and KoboCollect** to performing advanced statistical analysis with **R, Python, Stata, and SQL**. I have managed data for 20+ multi-site research projects, including clinical trials, cohort studies, and large-scale health surveys, consistently achieving 99%+ data quality.

## **My Journey**

My path into health data science emerged from a deep conviction that **rigorous data management is the foundation of credible research**. Over the past 7+ years, I've had the privilege of:

- Leading data management for **multi-country HIV treatment trials** with 1,200+ participants
- Designing **electronic data capture systems** for studies enrolling 5,000+ participants
- Creating **interactive dashboards** that reduce decision-making time from weeks to minutes
- Training **500+ researchers** in R programming and data management best practices
- Contributing to **health policy decisions** through evidence-based analytics

## **What Drives Me**

::: {.highlight-box}
### üéØ My Professional Mission

To bridge the gap between raw health data and meaningful insights that improve lives. I believe that:

- **Data quality is non-negotiable** - Every data point represents a person
- **Open science advances health** - Reproducible research should be the standard
- **Technology should empower** - Tools should solve problems, not create them
- **Capacity building multiplies impact** - Teaching others creates lasting change

## **Current Focus**

### üéì MSc Thesis Research

I'm currently completing my **MSc in Epidemiology and Biostatistics** at JOOUST, with my thesis examining:

**"Exploring Financial Determinants of Effective Hypertension and Diabetes Management in Primary Health Facilities in Kisumu County"**

This research investigates the critical intersection of health facility financing and NCD management outcomes, employing:
- Mixed-methods case study design
- Financial assessments of 30+ health facilities
- Patient outcome tracking (500+ participants)
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring
