## **Who I Am**

I am a **Research Data Manager, Research Data Analyst, and M&E Specialist** with **8+ years of progressive experience** driving evidence-based decision-making for multi-million dollar international projects in **global health, food security, and economic development**.

My career combines **end-to-end data management**, **advanced statistical analysis**, **rigorous M&E frameworks**, **field operations leadership**, and **capacity building**. Currently with **Georgetown University gui2de** conducting RCTs and impact evaluations, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive program success and policy change.

**What makes me different:** I've led the complete project lifecycle‚Äîfrom designing M&E frameworks and training field teams of 50+ enumerators, to conducting high-frequency checks (HFCs) in R & Stata, to delivering compelling donor reports. With **Washington University M&E Certification** (2025) and 3 published papers, I bring both academic rigor and practical field experience.

## **My Journey: Against All Odds**

::: {.highlight-box}
### üåü From Orphaned Child to Global Health Leader

Growing up **orphaned with limited resources** in rural Kenya, the odds were stacked against me. Without the safety net many take for granted, every educational milestone‚Äîfrom primary school to earning my BSc (Honours) at University of Nairobi (top quartile)‚Äîrequired extraordinary determination.

**Against all odds, I made it this far.** These experiences didn't just shape my character; they became my greatest professional assets:

**What adversity taught me:**
- **Resilience** - Loss instilled an unshakeable drive to create lasting impact
- **Resourcefulness** - Scarcity sharpened my problem-solving and innovation skills
- **Empathy** - Personal struggles deepened my commitment to health equity
- **Gratitude** - Mentors' support fueled my passion for capacity building
- **Team spirit** - Community taught me that collaboration multiplies impact

**I believe data can change lives**‚Äîand I've dedicated my career to proving it.
:::

### **Career Highlights:**

- **Georgetown University gui2de** - Leading RCTs and impact evaluations for health/development programs
- **KEMRI** - Transformed oncology data into policy-driving cancer epidemiology dashboards
- **LERIS Hub** - Built M&E frameworks for 8 health programs, led consultancies
- **Multi-country projects** - Coordinated data across Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania (1,535+ sites)
- **500+ researchers trained** - Capacity building in R, Stata, M&E, data management
- **3 publications** - Cancer epidemiology (data manager & analyst)
- **KES 20M+ cost savings** identified through rigorous analytics

## **What Drives Me**

::: {.highlight-box}
### üéØ My Professional Mission

To bridge the gap between raw health data and meaningful insights that improve lives. I believe that:

- **Data quality is non-negotiable** - Every data point represents a person
- **Open science advances health** - Reproducible research should be the standard
- **Technology should empower** - Tools should solve problems, not create them
- **Capacity building multiplies impact** - Teaching others creates lasting change

## **Current Focus**

### üéì MSc Thesis Research

I'm currently completing my **MSc in Epidemiology and Biostatistics** at JOOUST, with my thesis examining:

**"Exploring Financial Determinants of Effective Hypertension and Diabetes Management in Primary Health Facilities in Kisumu County"**

This research investigates the critical intersection of health facility financing and NCD management outcomes, employing:
- Mixed-methods case study design
- Financial assessments of 30+ health facilities
- Patient outcome tracking (500+ participants)
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring
