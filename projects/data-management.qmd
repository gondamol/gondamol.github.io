## **Data Quality Frameworks**

### **6. Automated Data Quality Monitoring System**

::: {.project-card}
::: {.project-header}
#### ✅ Proactive Data Quality Management
**Developed:** 2020 | **Status:** Used in 10+ projects
:::

::: {.project-body}
**Problem:**
- Manual data quality checks time-consuming and error-prone
- Quality issues discovered late in project lifecycle
- Inconsistent quality standards across projects

**Solution:**
- Developed comprehensive automated DQ monitoring framework
- Implemented in R as reusable package
- Integrated with REDCap, CSV imports, and SQL databases

**Framework Components:**

**1. Data Quality Dimensions:**
- **Completeness:** Missing data detection
- **Validity:** Range and format checks
- **Consistency:** Cross-field validation
- **Timeliness:** Data entry delays
- **Accuracy:** Logical inconsistencies
- **Uniqueness:** Duplicate detection

**2. Automated Checks:**
```r
# Example DQ checks
dq_framework <- DataQualityChecker$new(data)

# Completeness checks
dq_framework$check_completeness(
  required_vars = c("patient_id", "visit_date", "outcome"),
  threshold = 0.95  # 95% completeness required
)

# Validity checks
dq_framework$check_ranges(
  age = c(18, 100),
  bp_systolic = c(80, 220),
  bp_diastolic = c(40, 130)
)

# Consistency checks
dq_framework$check_consistency(
  rules = list(
    "death_date >= enrollment_date",
    "if outcome == 'pregnant' then sex == 'Female'",
    "if hiv_positive then hiv_test_date exists"
  )
)

# Generate report
dq_framework$generate_report(output = "html")
```

**3. Reporting:**
- Automated daily/weekly reports
- Traffic light system (red/yellow/green)
- Drill-down capabilities to problem records
- Trend analysis over time

**Impact Across Projects:**
- ✅ DQ issues detected 70% earlier in project lifecycle
- ✅ Data cleaning time reduced by 50%
- ✅ Standardized quality metrics across organization
- ✅ Used in 10+ studies managing 200,000+ records
