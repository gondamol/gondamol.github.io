### **4. Tuberculosis Contact Tracing Network Analysis**

::: {.project-card}
::: {.project-header}
#### 🔬 Network Analysis for Enhanced TB Control
**Status:** Completed | **Publication:** In Review | **Social Media Ready:** ✅
:::

::: {.project-body}
**Challenge:** Traditional contact tracing missing secondary and tertiary TB transmissions.

**Solution:** Network analysis approach to map TB transmission chains:
- Index case identification and interviewing
- Contact network mapping
- Risk stratification using network metrics
- Targeted screening interventions

**Findings:**
- 🔍 Average network size: 8.3 contacts (range: 2-47)
- 🔍 38% of secondary cases identified beyond traditional first-line contacts
- 🔍 "Super-spreaders" (>15 contacts) accounted for 52% of transmissions
- 🔍 Workplace and transport hubs were key transmission sites

**Impact:**
- ✅ 847 TB cases identified (42% increase over standard tracing)
- ✅ Earlier case detection (average 3 weeks earlier)
- ✅ Network-based approach adopted as county standard
- ✅ Cost-effectiveness ratio: $45 per case detected (vs. $120 standard)

**Technologies:** R (igraph, visNetwork), PostgreSQL, Shiny, d3.js

**Social Media Highlight:**
> "Network science meets TB control! Our innovative contact tracing approach detected 42% more TB cases than traditional methods, finding hidden transmission chains. 847 lives potentially saved through data-driven epidemiology. #Epidemiology #NetworkScience #TBControl"
