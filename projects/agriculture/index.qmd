## 🌾 Overview

Applying data science and economic analysis to agricultural investment decisions in Homabay County, Kenya. These projects combine statistical analysis, financial modeling, and local agricultural knowledge to support evidence-based farming ventures.

### Personal Context

I'm planning commercial farming operations in **Rachuonyo North (Homa Hills)**, **Suba**, and **Ndhiwa** sub-counties in Homabay County - my place of birth. These analyses inform real investment decisions for livestock and crop farming.

**Current Operations**: 7 goats + 15 sheep | **Target**: Commercial scale by 2026
