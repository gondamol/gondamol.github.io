## **🚀 Current Projects**

### **surveyKE: Advanced Survey Tools for Kenya & Africa** {.highlight-box}

::: {style="margin: 2rem 0;"}
**Status:** 🔨 In Development  
**GitHub:** [github.com/gondamol/surveyKE](https://github.com/gondamol/surveyKE) *(Coming Soon)*  
**License:** MIT

**Inspired by:** [surveydown](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown) - but designed specifically for African research contexts
:::

#### **The Vision**

surveyKE is an R package designed to simplify survey design, implementation, and data management for researchers working in Kenya and across Africa. It addresses unique challenges faced in low-resource settings.

#### **Key Features** {.info-box}

**1. Advanced Skip Logic**
- Complex conditional branching
- Nested logic without coding complexity
- Visual logic builder for non-programmers
- Support for multi-level household surveys

**2. Robust Validation**
- Real-time data validation
- Context-aware checks (e.g., Kenya ID validation)
- Geographic validation (county, sub-county codes)
- Mobile number formats (Safaricom, Airtel, etc.)
- M-PESA transaction validation

**3. Offline-First Design**
- Works without internet connection
- Auto-sync when connectivity returns
- Local data storage with encryption
- Ideal for rural field work

**4. Multi-Language Support**
- English, Swahili, and local languages
- Easy translation workflow
- Language switching mid-survey
- Audio questions for low-literacy contexts

**5. Mobile-Optimized**
- Responsive design for all devices
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Low data consumption
- Works on basic smartphones

**6. Integration with Popular Tools**
- Export to ODK, SurveyCTO, REDCap
- Direct connection to R analysis pipelines
- Shiny dashboard generation
- Automated reporting

#### **Why surveyKE?** {.success-box}

**Existing tools like surveydown are excellent but:**
- Often require strong internet connectivity
- May not handle African context validations (ID formats, phone numbers, geographic codes)
- Can be complex for teams with limited programming experience
- Don't always work well offline

**surveyKE aims to be:**
- **Simpler** - Drag-and-drop interface with code export
- **Context-aware** - Built for African data collection realities
- **Robust** - Advanced validation and error handling
- **Offline-capable** - Essential for rural field work
- **Cost-effective** - Open source, no licensing fees

## **Example Use Cases**

### **1. Health Financial Diaries** {.project-card}

```r
library(surveyKE)

# Create a financial diary survey with automatic skip logic
diary <- survey_ke(
  title = "Health Financial Diary",
  language = c("en", "sw"),
  offline = TRUE
) %>%
  add_section("Daily Income",
    questions = list(
      q_income("income_today", "How much did you earn today?"),
      q_source("income_source", "What was the source?", 
               skip_if = "income_today == 0")
    )
  ) %>%
  add_section("Health Expenditure",
    questions = list(
      q_health_spend("health_cost", "Any health spending today?"),
      q_reason("health_reason", "What was it for?",
               skip_if = "health_cost == 0"),
      q_coping("coping_strategy", "How did you pay?",
               show_if = "health_cost > 1000")
    )
  ) %>%
  add_validation(
    check_daily_balance(),
    flag_unusual_spending(),
    validate_dates()
  )

# Deploy to mobile devices
deploy_survey(diary, mode = "mobile", offline = TRUE)
```

### **2. RCT Baseline Survey with Complex Logic** {.project-card}

```r
baseline <- survey_ke(
  title = "Hypertension Management RCT - Baseline",
  id_validation = "kenya_national_id"
) %>%
  add_demographics() %>%  # Pre-built module
  add_section("Clinical History",
    questions = list(
      q_diagnosis("hypertension", "Diagnosed with hypertension?"),
      q_date("diagnosis_date", "When were you diagnosed?",
             show_if = "hypertension == 'Yes'"),
      q_medication("current_meds", "Current medications",
                   show_if = "hypertension == 'Yes'",
                   validate = validate_kenya_medications())
    )
  ) %>%
  add_household_roster() %>%  # Another pre-built module
  add_consent_form(
    require_signature = TRUE,
    language = c("en", "sw", "luo")
  )
```

## **Why Open Source?**

::: {.highlight-box}
**My philosophy:**

Research tools should be **accessible to everyone**, especially in low-resource settings. Open source software:

- **Reduces costs** for African researchers and organizations
- **Builds capacity** through transparent code
- **Encourages collaboration** across institutions
- **Improves quality** through community review
- **Creates sustainability** beyond individual projects

*"Good tools multiply the impact of good research."*
