## **Quick Tips & Code Snippets**

::: {.info-box}
### Useful R Code Snippets

**REDCap Data Import:**
```r
library(httr)
library(tidyverse)

# Import data from REDCap
redcap_data <- postForm(
  uri = "https://redcap.example.com/api/",
  token = Sys.getenv("REDCAP_TOKEN"),
  content = "record",
  format = "csv"
) %>% 
  read_csv()
```

**Data Quality Check:**
```r
# Check missing data
missing_summary <- data %>%
  summarise(across(everything(), 
    ~sum(is.na(.)) / length(.) * 100)) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), 
    names_to = "variable", 
    values_to = "percent_missing")
```
