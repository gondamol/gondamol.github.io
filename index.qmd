## **My Journey: Against All Odds**

::: {.highlight-box}
### üåü From Orphaned Child to Global Health Leader

Growing up **orphaned with limited resources** in rural Kenya, the odds were stacked against me. Every educational milestone required extraordinary determination and resourcefulness. **Against all odds, I made it this far** - and these experiences shaped who I am today:

**What adversity taught me:**
- **Resilience** - Loss instilled a drive to create lasting impact
- **Resourcefulness** - Scarcity sharpened my problem-solving abilities  
- **Empathy** - Personal challenges deepened my commitment to health equity  
- **Gratitude** - Support from mentors fueled my passion for capacity building

**I believe data can change lives** - and I've dedicated my career to proving it. Now positioned to lead transformative global health initiatives, I bring not just technical skills, but a deep understanding of the communities we serve.
